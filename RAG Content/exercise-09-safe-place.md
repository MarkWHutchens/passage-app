# Exercise: Safe Place Visualization

## What This Is

A guided visualization to create and visit a mental "safe place" - an imaginary space where you feel completely calm and secure.

This becomes a resource you can return to anytime you need to feel grounded and safe.

## When to Use It

- When you're anxious or overwhelmed
- When you need a mental break
- Before sleep
- During panic
- Anytime you need to feel safe and calm

## Important Note

If visualization is difficult for you, that's okay. Some people see vivid images; others get more of a sense or feeling. Work with whatever comes - there's no wrong way.

## Building Your Safe Place

Close your eyes if comfortable, or soften your gaze.

Take a few slow breaths.

### Create the Space

Imagine a place where you feel completely safe and at peace.

It might be:
- A beach
- A forest
- A cozy room
- A mountain meadow
- A garden
- Somewhere from childhood
- Somewhere completely imagined

There's no right answer. Just let a place come to mind - somewhere you feel calm and protected.

What place is coming up for you?

### Look Around

Now let yourself be there. You're in this safe place.

Look around slowly.

**What do you see?**
What's around you? What colors? What shapes? What's in the distance? What's nearby?

Take your time. Let the details fill in.

### Notice the Other Senses

**What do you hear?**
Is it quiet? Are there sounds? Water? Birds? Wind? Silence?

**What do you feel?**
The temperature - warm? Cool? 
What's under your feet or body?
Any breeze on your skin?

**What do you smell?**
Fresh air? Flowers? Ocean? Wood? Nothing particular?

Let yourself really be there.

### Feel the Safety

In this place, you are completely safe.
Nothing can harm you here.
No one needs anything from you.
You can just be.

Let your body relax into that safety.

Feel the ground supporting you.
Feel the peace of this place.

---

### Stay a While

Spend another moment here. 

This place is always available to you. You can return anytime you need to.

Breathe.

---

### Coming Back

When you're ready, slowly bring your attention back to the room you're actually in.

Feel your body in the chair or on the floor.

Hear the sounds around you.

When you're ready, open your eyes.

## Using Your Safe Place

Now that you've created it, you can return anytime:

- Close your eyes
- Take a breath
- Go to your safe place
- Stay as long as you need
- Return to the present when ready

The more you visit, the easier it becomes to get there and the more real it feels.

You can use it for 30 seconds or 10 minutes. It's yours.

## How Claude Should Guide This

- Speak slowly and soothingly
- Pause to let them actually imagine
- Don't describe a specific place - let them create their own
- Ask questions rather than telling them what they see
- This should feel calm and unhurried
- Check in afterward: "How was that? What place came to you?"
