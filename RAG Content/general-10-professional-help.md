# When to Seek Professional Help

## You Don't Have to Do This Alone

Friends, family, and apps like this can provide meaningful support. But sometimes you need more - professional help from someone trained to help with what you're going through.

Seeking professional help isn't failure. It's wisdom about what different resources can offer.

## Signs You Might Need Professional Help

- Can't work or maintain responsibilities

- Can't maintain relationships
- Daily life has become unmanageable

**This requires immediate professional attention.**
If you're having thoughts of ending your life, please reach out to a crisis line or go to an emergency room.

### You're stuck
- Trying things but nothing's helping
- Same patterns repeating despite effort
- Can't move through grief/transition/recovery
- Feeling hopeless about change

### Symptoms are severe or worsening
- Panic attacks
- Severe depression

- Dissociation or feeling unreal
- Symptoms getting worse over time

### Trauma needs processing

## Types of Professional Help

**Approaches vary:** CBT, psychodynamic, EMDR, somatic, etc. Different approaches work for different people.

### Psychiatrists
**What they do:** Medical doctors who can prescribe medication. Some do therapy; many focus on medication management.

**When to see one:** If medication might help (depression, anxiety, bipolar, ADHD, etc.)

### Your Primary Care Doctor
**What they can do:** Screen for mental health issues, prescribe some medications, refer to specialists, rule out physical causes.

**A good starting point** if you're unsure where to begin.

### Support Groups
**What they do:** Peer support. People with shared experiences supporting each other.

**Examples:** AA/NA, grief groups, divorce support, chronic illness groups, etc.

**Why they help:** You're not alone. Others understand. Community support complements individual work.

**When to use:** Active suicidal ideation, psychotic break, danger to self or others, can't keep yourself safe.

## How to Find Help

### Start somewhere
- Ask your doctor for referrals
- Ask friends who've been in therapy for recommendations
- Use your insurance's provider directory
- Psychology Today's therapist finder
- Employee assistance programs (EAP) at work

### What to look for
- Licensed and credentialed
- Experience with your issues
- Approach that fits you
- Someone you feel comfortable with

### The first session
It's okay to "shop around." The relationship matters more than the credentials. If it doesn't feel right, try someone else.

### Cost concerns
- Many therapists offer sliding scale
- Community mental health centers
- Training clinics at universities
- Online therapy (often cheaper)
- Insurance coverage varies
- EAP programs are often free

Cost shouldn't be an absolute barrier. Options exist.

## Barriers to Getting Help

### "I should be able to handle this myself"
You handle many things yourself. Some things benefit from expert help. You wouldn't set your own broken bone.

### "It's not bad enough"
You don't have to hit bottom. Earlier help is easier help. Prevention is better than crisis management.

### "Therapy is for crazy people"
Therapy is for humans with problems. That's everyone at some point.

### "It won't help"
You don't know until you try. And the research says it does help, for most people, most of the time.

### "I don't have time/money"
These are real constraints. But consider the cost of NOT getting help - in suffering, lost productivity, damaged relationships.

### "I don't know where to start"
Start with one phone call. Or ask someone to help you start.

## Making the Most of Professional Help

- Be honest (they can't help if you're not)
- Show up consistently
- Do the work between sessions
- Give it time (change isn't instant)
- Speak up if something isn't working
- Remember you're in charge of your care

## When to Reference This

Use this framework when:
- Someone is struggling and might benefit from professional help
- They're hesitant or resistant to seeing a professional
- They don't know what types of help exist
- They're unsure if their situation warrants professional support
- They need guidance on how to find help
- They're minimizing symptoms that warrant attention
