# Stay or Go: Deciding About Your Job After Burnout

## The Big Question

At some point, most people recovering from burnout ask: should I stay or should I go?

There's no universal right answer. Some people need to leave. Some can rebuild where they are. Some are too depleted to know yet.

This is a framework for thinking it through.

## Don't Decide Too Soon

Burnout impairs judgment. When you're depleted, everything looks bleak. Decisions made in the pit of burnout may not reflect what you'll want when you've recovered.

**If possible:**
- Avoid major decisions until acute burnout has passed
- Give yourself time to recover enough to think clearly
- Gather information without committing
- Talk to people you trust

The exception: if the situation is actively harmful (abuse, dangerous conditions, serious health impact), get out regardless of timing.

## Questions to Help Clarify

### About the Job

**Is the problem fixable?**
- Is it workload that could be adjusted?
- Is it a specific person or situation that could change?
- Is it something you could address with boundaries?
- Or is it fundamental to the role/organisation?

**Has anything actually changed?**
- Or are you being asked to return to identical conditions?
- Is there willingness to make adjustments?
- Have you tried raising concerns? What happened?

**Is this environment toxic?**
- Are the problems systemic?
- Do others burn out here too?
- Is there a pattern of chewing people up?

**What would have to be different for it to be sustainable?**
- Is that realistic?
- Can you make it happen?

### About You

**What do you actually want?**
- Setting aside fear, obligation, and guilt - what do you want?
- Does this work align with your values?
- Do you want to do this kind of work?

**What are your patterns?**
- Is this job uniquely problematic, or would you burn out anywhere?
- Are there patterns you'd take with you?
- Would changing jobs solve it, or just move it?

**What do you need?**
- More rest? Different work? Same work with boundaries? Complete change?

**What's your financial reality?**
- Can you afford to leave?
- How long could you manage without income?
- What's the cost of staying vs. leaving?

### About the Decision

**What does your body tell you?**
- When you imagine staying, what happens physically?
- When you imagine leaving, what happens?
- Your body often knows before your mind does.

**What would you tell a friend in this situation?**
- We're often wiser about others' lives than our own.

**What are you afraid of?**
- Staying: continued depletion, wasted years, health impact
- Leaving: uncertainty, financial risk, identity loss
- Which fear is more bearable?

## Signs You Might Need to Leave

- The environment is fundamentally toxic and won't change
- Your health is seriously affected
- You've tried everything and nothing improves
- You dread it at a level that's beyond normal
- The misalignment with your values is too great
- You're staying only out of fear
- Everyone who's been honest says you should go
- You can't imagine recovering while staying

## Signs You Might Be Able to Stay

- The problems are addressable (workload, specific issues)
- There's genuine willingness to make changes
- A different role or team might work
- The issue was largely your patterns, not the environment
- You have leverage to negotiate what you need
- You still find meaning in the work itself
- You can set boundaries that will be respected
- Leaving would create problems worse than staying

## The Middle Options

It's not just stay or go. Consider:

**Internal change:** Different role, team, or responsibilities within the same organisation.

**Reduced engagement:** Part-time, contract, or reduced scope.

**Leave of absence:** Extended break without burning bridges.

**Negotiate:** Ask for what you need and see what happens.

**Plan a transition:** Stay while you prepare for something else.

## Making the Decision

### Gather information
- Talk to people
- Understand your options
- Know your finances
- Research alternatives

### Listen to yourself
- What does your gut say?
- What does your body say?
- What do you really want, underneath the fear?

### Make a choice
- At some point, you have to decide
- Indecision is also a choice (to stay in limbo)
- No decision is risk-free

### Accept uncertainty
- You won't know for sure if it's the right call
- You can only make the best decision with what you know now
- If it's wrong, you can adjust

## After Deciding

**If you stay:** Implement changes. Set boundaries. Monitor yourself. Have a backup plan if it doesn't work.

**If you leave:** Don't look back constantly. Focus on recovery and next steps. Learn what you can from the experience.

Either way: the decision is made. Move forward.

## When to Reference This

Use this framework when:
- Someone is trying to decide whether to stay or leave
- They're stuck in indecision
- They need a structured way to think through the choice
- They're feeling pressure to decide before they're ready
- They're only seeing binary options (stay exactly as is or quit)
- They need permission to leave
- They need permission to stay and try to make it work
