# Pacing: Managing Limited Energy

## The Spoon Theory

You may have heard of "spoon theory" - the idea that people with chronic illness have limited energy units (spoons) each day. Once they're gone, they're gone.

Healthy people have nearly unlimited spoons. They don't think about energy. People with chronic illness must budget carefully.

This isn't laziness. It's math.

## The Energy Problem

Chronic illness often means:
- Less total energy than before
- Unpredictable energy (good days and bad days)
- Energy that doesn't replenish like it used to
- Consequences for overdoing it (crashes, flares)
- Having to choose between activities healthy people do without thinking

## Push-Crash Cycle

Many people with chronic illness fall into a pattern:

1. Feel okay (or feel determined)
2. Do all the things
3. Crash - exhaustion, flare, symptoms worsen
4. Rest until somewhat recovered
5. Feel guilty about doing nothing
6. Repeat

This cycle is destructive. The crashes often cost more than you gained during the push.

## Pacing: A Different Approach

Pacing means deliberately moderating activity to stay within your energy budget.

### Core principles

**Know your limits.** Pay attention to what actually depletes you and what you can sustain. This varies by person and by day.

**Stop before you crash.** Don't wait until you're empty. Stop while you still have something left.

**Rest before you need to.** Preventive rest maintains capacity. Desperate rest after crashing is just damage control.

**Consistency over bursts.** Doing a little each day beats doing a lot then crashing.

**Include recovery in the plan.** Activity needs rest to balance it. Build in rest, don't just let it happen by collapse.

### Practical strategies

**Activity diaries.** Track what you do and how you feel. Patterns will emerge.

**Priority lists.** What actually matters? What can be dropped? Be ruthless.

**Time limits.** Set timers. Do 20 minutes, then rest. Don't go until you're exhausted.

**Modify activities.** Sit instead of stand. Ask for help. Use tools that save energy.

**Plan ahead.** Know what's coming. If tomorrow is demanding, rest today.

**Build in buffers.** Don't schedule back to back. Leave space.

**Say no.** Protect your energy. Others' expectations don't determine your limits.

## What Pacing Isn't

### It's not giving up

Pacing isn't surrendering to illness. It's managing strategically so you can sustain activity over time.

### It's not laziness

Pacing is active management of a limited resource. It takes effort and discipline.

### It's not forever at this level

Pacing helps you function within current limits. Limits may change over time.

## The Grief of Pacing

Pacing requires accepting limits you wish you didn't have. This involves grief:

- Grief for the energy you used to have
- Grief for activities you can't sustain
- Grief for spontaneity and freedom
- Grief for the life that didn't need budgeting

Allow the grief. Then pace anyway.

## When Others Don't Understand

"But you don't look sick." "You seemed fine yesterday." "Just push through it."

People who haven't experienced energy limitation often don't understand. Options:

- Explain spoon theory or energy budgeting
- Set boundaries without detailed justification
- Find people who do understand (often others with chronic illness)
- Accept that some people won't get it and protect yourself anyway

## Pacing and Mental Health

Pacing applies to emotional energy too:

- Some interactions are draining
- Emotional processing takes energy
- Stress depletes faster
- Social activity (even good) costs something

Budget emotional energy like physical energy.

## When Pacing Feels Impossible

Some situations don't allow pacing:
- Work demands that exceed capacity
- Caregiving responsibilities
- Financial pressure to do more than you can sustain
- Crisis periods

When you can't pace:
- Accept that you'll pay a cost
- Rest as much as possible around the non-negotiables
- Look for any way to reduce the load
- Know that survival mode is temporary
- Get support

## When to Reference This

Use this framework when:
- Someone is caught in push-crash cycles
- They're struggling to manage limited energy
- They feel guilty about resting
- They need practical pacing strategies
- They're grieving their energy limitations
- Others don't understand their limits
- They need help prioritising with limited resources
