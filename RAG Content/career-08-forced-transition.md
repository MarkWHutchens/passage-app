# When You Didn't Choose This

## Two Kinds of Transition

**Chosen transition:**
You decided to leave. You resigned. You made a change. Whatever comes next, you initiated this.

**Forced transition:**
You were laid off. Made redundant. Fired. Pushed out. Became unable to work. The decision wasn't yours.

Both are hard. But forced transition carries an extra layer.

## What Forced Transition Adds

### Loss of Control

Chosen transition, however scary, involves agency. You made a decision. You have some power.

Forced transition removes agency. Something happened TO you. You're responding to someone else's decision.

This loss of control can be destabilising even beyond the practical implications.

### The Injury of Rejection

Being let go, especially if you were fired rather than laid off, often feels like rejection:
- "I wasn't good enough"
- "They didn't want me"
- "I failed"

Even layoffs, which are often about economics not performance, can feel personal.

### Shame

Forced transition often comes with shame:
- Embarrassment about what happened
- Not wanting to tell people
- Feeling like a failure
- Comparing yourself to those who weren't let go

Shame makes everything harder. It isolates you when you need support.

### Anger

If you were treated unfairly, anger is appropriate. You might be angry at:
- The company
- Specific people who made the decision
- The economy or circumstances
- Yourself (sometimes misplaced)

Anger is valid but needs somewhere to go.

### Financial Shock

Chosen transition often involves planning - savings built, runway calculated, next steps lined up.

Forced transition may come without warning. The financial shock compounds the emotional one.

## Processing the Forced Transition

### Feel What You Feel

Shock, anger, shame, fear, grief - don't skip over these. They're appropriate responses to what happened.

Stuffing them down doesn't make them go away. It just delays and distorts them.

### Separate What Happened From Your Worth

**Getting laid off ≠ being worthless**
**Being fired ≠ being a failure**
**Forced transition ≠ your fault**

Sometimes bad things happen to good workers. Companies make bad decisions. Economies shift. Life isn't fair.

What happened is information about circumstances. It's not the final verdict on your value.

### Tell Your Story

You'll need to explain what happened - to potential employers, to friends, to yourself.

Work on a narrative that's:
- Honest (don't lie, it backfires)
- Brief (long explanations sound defensive)
- Forward-looking (what you learned, where you're headed)
- Not bitter (even if you have reason to be)

"My role was eliminated in restructuring. It was disappointing but I'm using it as an opportunity to [X]."

You don't have to share everything. You just need a workable story.

### Get Support

Shame makes people hide. Resist this. Reach out to:
- Trusted friends and family
- Others who've been through similar
- Professional support if needed

You don't have to go through this alone.

### Reclaim Agency

You didn't choose this transition. But you can choose how you respond:
- What you learn from it
- How you spend your time
- What you pursue next
- Who you become through it

The transition was forced. The response is yours.

## The Silver Lining (Maybe)

Sometimes forced transitions lead somewhere you wouldn't have gone voluntarily - and it turns out to be better.

This isn't guaranteed. It's not a reason to be grateful for being pushed out. But sometimes:
- The job you lost wasn't right for you anyway
- The push forces a change you needed but wouldn't have made
- New doors open that were invisible before
- You discover resilience you didn't know you had

You don't have to see the silver lining immediately. Or ever. But stay open to the possibility that this disruption leads somewhere valuable.

## When Forced Transition Keeps Happening

If you've been let go multiple times, additional reflection may be warranted:
- Are there patterns in why it's happening?
- Is there feedback you've been given that you haven't addressed?
- Are you in the wrong field or type of role?
- Is something about how you work not fitting?

This isn't about blame. It's about honest assessment. Sometimes repeated forced transitions contain information worth examining.

## The Longer View

Most careers include some involuntary disruption. Layoffs happen. Companies fail. Industries shift. Very few people make it to retirement without being pushed out of something at some point.

This doesn't make it easier in the moment. But it does mean you're not uniquely cursed. You're experiencing something that's part of working life for most people.

And people recover. They find new roles. They rebuild. Sometimes they end up somewhere better.

You probably will too.

## When to Reference This

Use this framework when:
- Someone was laid off, fired, or pushed out
- They're feeling shame about what happened
- They're struggling with loss of control
- They're angry and don't know what to do with it
- They need to work on their narrative
- They're hiding instead of getting support
- They need perspective on forced transition
