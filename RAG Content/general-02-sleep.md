# Sleep: The Foundation of Everything

## Why Sleep Matters So Much

Whatever you're going through, sleep is foundational.

Without adequate sleep:
- Emotional regulation tanks
- Anxiety increases
- Depression worsens
- Cognitive function impairs
- Physical healing slows
- Cravings intensify
- Stress tolerance drops
- Everything gets harder

Sleep isn't a luxury. It's medicine.

## What Good Sleep Looks Like

**Duration:** Most adults need 7-9 hours. Some need more, especially during recovery from anything.

**Quality:** Uninterrupted cycles through sleep stages. Waking rested.

**Consistency:** Regular sleep and wake times. Your body likes rhythm.

**Ease:** Falling asleep without major struggle. Returning to sleep after waking.

## What Disrupts Sleep

### Behavioural
- Irregular schedule
- Screens before bed
- Caffeine too late in the day
- Alcohol (seems to help, actually disrupts)
- Lack of physical activity
- Napping too long or too late
- Using bed for work, scrolling, worrying

### Environmental
- Too much light
- Too much noise
- Wrong temperature (usually too warm)
- Uncomfortable bed
- Partner disturbances

### Physiological
- Chronic pain
- Illness
- Hormonal changes
- Medications
- Withdrawal from substances
- Sleep disorders (apnea, restless legs)

### Psychological
- Anxiety
- Depression
- Racing thoughts
- Trauma / hypervigilance
- Grief
- Stress

## Sleep Hygiene: The Basics

These aren't exciting, but they work:

### Timing
- **Consistent wake time** - most important. Same time every day, even weekends.
- **Consistent bedtime** - regular, but don't force sleep
- **Avoid naps after 3pm** - or keep them short (20 min)

### Light
- **Bright light in the morning** - signals wake up
- **Dim light in the evening** - signals wind down
- **No screens 1 hour before bed** - or use blue light filters
- **Dark room for sleeping** - blackout if needed

### Substances
- **No caffeine after noon** (earlier if sensitive)
- **Limit alcohol** - it fragments sleep, even if it helps you fall asleep
- **No smoking near bedtime** - nicotine is a stimulant

### Bed Use
- **Bed is for sleep (and sex)** - not scrolling, working, worrying
- **If you can't sleep, get up** - don't lie awake for hours
- **Return when drowsy** - not when you've decided you should sleep

### Environment
- **Cool room** - 65-68°F / 18-20°C for most people
- **Dark** - cover lights, use blackout curtains
- **Quiet** - white noise if needed
- **Comfortable bed** - invest if you can

### Wind-Down Routine
- **1 hour before bed** - start dimming lights, calming down
- **Avoid stimulating content** - news, conflict, thrillers
- **Relaxing activities** - reading, gentle stretching, bath
- **Write tomorrow's concerns** - get them out of your head

## When You Can't Sleep

### Racing thoughts
- Write them down - externalize
- Breathing exercises
- Body scan meditation
- Boring podcasts or audiobooks
- "Worry time" earlier in the day - designated, not at bedtime

### Anxiety about not sleeping
Ironically, worrying about sleep prevents sleep.
- Accept that tonight might be a bad night
- Remind yourself: one bad night is survivable
- Don't clock-watch
- Rest even if you can't sleep - it's still restorative

### The 20-minute rule
If you've been awake more than 20 minutes (estimate, don't clock-watch):
1. Get up
2. Go to another room
3. Do something quiet and boring (dim light, no screens)
4. Return only when drowsy
5. Repeat if needed

This prevents associating bed with frustration.

## Special Circumstances

### Grief
- Sleep disruption is normal
- Don't expect perfect sleep during acute grief
- Do what you can; forgive what you can't

### Recovery from addiction
- Sleep will be disrupted early on (see addiction content)
- It improves with time
- Don't replace substances with sleep aids

### Trauma
- Hypervigilance disrupts sleep
- Safety before sleep (environment, routines)
- Consider trauma therapy
- Don't force yourself to relax (can backfire)

### Depression
- May sleep too much or too little
- Morning light especially important
- Activity during day helps
- Address the depression, not just the sleep

## When to Get Help

See a doctor if:
- You're exhausted despite sleeping enough hours
- You snore loudly or stop breathing (might be apnea)
- Restless legs disrupt sleep
- Sleep problems persist despite good sleep hygiene
- You're using substances to sleep

Some sleep problems need medical attention, not just better habits.

## When to Reference This

Use this framework when:
- Someone is struggling with sleep
- Their recovery is impaired by poor sleep
- They need practical sleep strategies
- They're relying on substances for sleep
- They need basic sleep hygiene
- Sleep disruption is affecting their mental health
