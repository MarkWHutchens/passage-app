# Exercise: Self-Compassion Break

## What This Is

A brief practice from Kristin Neff's self-compassion research. It has three parts:
1. Acknowledging the pain (mindfulness)
2. Remembering you're not alone (common humanity)
3. Offering yourself kindness (self-kindness)

It takes about two minutes and can shift how you're relating to difficulty.

## When to Use It

- When you're being hard on yourself
- When you're suffering and adding self-criticism on top
- When you've made a mistake
- When you're struggling and feel alone in it
- When you need a moment of care

## The Practice

Think of something that's causing you stress or pain right now. It doesn't have to be the biggest thing - just something that's bothering you.

Hold that situation in your mind as we go through these three steps.

### Step 1: Acknowledge the Pain

Say to yourself, silently or out loud:

**"This is a moment of suffering."**

Or use whatever words feel natural:
- "This is hard."
- "This hurts."
- "I'm struggling right now."

Don't minimize it. Don't dramatize it. Just acknowledge: this is difficult.

Take a breath.

### Step 2: Remember Common Humanity

Say to yourself:

**"Suffering is part of being human."**

Or:
- "I'm not alone in this."
- "Other people feel this way too."
- "This is part of the shared human experience."

You're not uniquely broken. You're not the only one who has ever felt this. Millions of humans have struggled with similar pain.

Take a breath.

### Step 3: Offer Yourself Kindness

Place your hand on your heart if that feels comfortable.

Say to yourself:

**"May I be kind to myself."**

Or choose what you most need to hear:
- "May I give myself the compassion I need."
- "May I accept myself as I am."
- "May I be patient with myself."
- "May I be strong."

What do you need to hear right now? Offer that to yourself.

Take a breath.

## Finishing

Let your hand return to your lap if you raised it.

Notice how you feel. Something may have shifted, even slightly. Or it may take practice before you feel a difference.

This is a skill. The more you practice, the more available it becomes when you need it.

---

## If It Feels Awkward

Self-compassion can feel strange, especially if you're used to being hard on yourself. That's normal.

You don't have to believe the words completely. Just say them. Practice the motion. Over time, it becomes more natural.

If it brings up emotion, that's okay too. Sometimes being kind to yourself opens up pain that's been held back. Let it move through.

## How Claude Should Guide This

- Speak gently and slowly
- Pause after each step for them to actually do it
- Offer the alternative phrasings - different words resonate for different people
- Don't force emotion or expect a dramatic shift
- Check in simply at the end: "How was that?"
