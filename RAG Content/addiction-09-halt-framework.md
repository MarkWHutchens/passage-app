# HALT: The Basic Vulnerability Check

## What Is HALT?

HALT is a simple acronym used in recovery to identify states that increase vulnerability to relapse:

**H** - Hungry
**A** - Angry
**L** - Lonely
**T** - Tired

When you're experiencing cravings, irritability, or feeling shaky in your recovery, check these four basics first.

## Why HALT Matters

These four states affect:
- Willpower and decision-making capacity
- Emotional regulation
- Stress tolerance
- Craving intensity
- Ability to use coping skills

Often, addressing the basic need resolves or reduces the craving.

## H - Hungry

**What happens when you're hungry:**
- Blood sugar drops
- Irritability increases
- Decision-making impairs
- Cravings for quick energy (including substances) spike
- Emotional tolerance drops

**In recovery specifically:**
- Many people in active addiction ate poorly
- Early recovery appetites can be unpredictable
- Blood sugar swings are common
- The brain needs fuel to regulate

**What to do:**
- Eat regular meals (don't skip)
- Carry snacks
- Notice the hunger-mood connection
- Protein and complex carbs stabilise better than sugar
- Before making any big decision or having a hard conversation: eat

**Quick check:** "When did I last eat?" If it's been hours, address that first.

## A - Angry

**What happens when you're angry:**
- Stress hormones flood the system
- Fight-or-flight activates
- Prefrontal cortex (rational brain) goes offline
- Impulsivity increases
- Substances offered a reliable way to manage anger

**In recovery specifically:**
- Emotions you numbed now have full volume
- Anger you've been stuffing comes out
- You may not have learned healthy anger expression
- Resentments are recovery killers

**What to do:**
- Name it: "I'm angry." Just naming helps.
- Don't act on anger impulsively
- Physical movement helps discharge the energy
- Talk to someone (not at the person you're angry with, not yet)
- Wait before having confrontations (24-hour rule)
- Examine: what's under the anger? Often it's hurt, fear, or unmet needs

**Quick check:** "What am I actually angry about?" Surface anger often masks deeper feelings.

## L - Lonely

**What happens when you're lonely:**
- Isolation increases vulnerability
- Shame thrives in secrecy
- No external perspective or reality check
- The substance was a reliable "companion"
- Nobody there to intervene or support

**In recovery specifically:**
- Addiction often destroyed relationships
- You may have lost using friends
- Shame keeps you from reaching out
- Social skills may be rusty
- Connection is essential to recovery

**What to do:**
- Reach out (call, text, go to a meeting)
- You don't have to be in crisis to connect - "just checking in" is valid
- Differentiate alone (okay) from lonely (dangerous)
- Physical presence helps (meeting, coffee shop, anywhere with people)
- Let people know you're struggling rather than performing "fine"

**Quick check:** "When did I last have genuine connection with another person?"

## T - Tired

**What happens when you're tired:**
- Willpower depletes (it's a limited resource)
- Emotional regulation tanks
- Everything feels harder
- Cravings increase
- Judgment impairs

**In recovery specifically:**
- Sleep disturbances are common in early recovery
- You may have used substances to manage sleep
- Your body is doing hard work healing
- Mental and emotional fatigue, not just physical

**What to do:**
- Prioritise sleep (it's not optional)
- Rest even if you can't sleep
- Reduce demands during high-fatigue periods
- Naps help if you can take them
- Don't make big decisions when exhausted
- Recognise that tired-you doesn't think clearly

**Quick check:** "Am I rested? When did I last sleep well?"

## How to Use HALT

**When you're struggling:**
1. Stop and ask: "Am I Hungry, Angry, Lonely, or Tired?"
2. If yes to any: address that need first
3. Then reassess - is the craving/problem still as intense?

**Proactively:**
1. Regular check-ins (morning, afternoon, evening)
2. Build routines that address all four (regular meals, processing emotions, connection, sleep)
3. Notice your patterns - which states hit you hardest?

**In high-risk moments:**
Before making any decision about recovery, using, or major life choices:
"Have I checked HALT?"

## Beyond Basic HALT

Some people expand the acronym:

**HALTS** - adds Sick/Stressed
**BLAST** - Bored, Lonely, Angry, Stressed, Tired

The core principle is the same: basic physical and emotional needs affect everything else. Address them first.

## When to Reference This

Use this framework when:
- Someone is struggling and can't identify why
- They're experiencing cravings without obvious trigger
- They're making poor decisions or feeling destabilised
- They're in early recovery and learning self-care basics
- They need a quick check-in tool
- They're about to do something risky and need a pause
- They dismiss self-care as unimportant to recovery
