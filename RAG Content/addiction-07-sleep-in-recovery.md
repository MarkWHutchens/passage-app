# Sleep in Recovery: Why It's Wrecked and How It Heals

## "But I Need It to Sleep"

This is one of the most common things people say about alcohol or benzodiazepines: "It's the only way I can get to sleep."

And at one level, it's true. Alcohol and benzos do knock you out. They quiet the racing mind. They take you out of your head. When you're lying there at 2am with thoughts spinning, a drink or a pill offers reliable unconsciousness.

But here's what's actually happening:

**Substance-induced sleep is not real sleep.** It's sedation.

- Alcohol suppresses REM sleep (the restorative, dream-rich stage)
- Sleep architecture is disrupted - you cycle through stages abnormally
- You wake more frequently (even if you don't remember it)
- The sleep is shallow, not deep
- You wake unrefreshed, even after 8 hours
- Your body never fully restores

That groggy, unrested feeling in the morning? That's not a hangover - that's what happens when your brain didn't get the sleep stages it needed.

**The cruel cycle:**
1. You can't sleep naturally (anxiety, racing mind)
2. You drink or use to knock yourself out
3. You get poor quality sleep
4. You wake exhausted
5. Exhaustion increases anxiety and irritability
6. Night comes and you can't sleep naturally
7. Back to step 2

The substance becomes the "solution" to a problem it's making worse.

**In recovery:** Yes, sleep will be harder at first without the chemical knockout. Your brain forgot how to fall asleep naturally. But the sleep you eventually get - real, natural sleep - will be more restorative than anything you got while using. It takes time, but it's worth it.

## The Truth About Sleep in Early Recovery

Sleep problems in early recovery are nearly universal. You're not doing anything wrong - this is your brain healing.

Common experiences:
- Difficulty falling asleep
- Waking frequently during the night
- Early morning waking (3-4am and can't get back to sleep)
- Vivid dreams, often disturbing
- Feeling unrested even after sleeping
- Racing thoughts at bedtime
- Exhaustion but unable to sleep

This is frustrating. And it's temporary.

## Why Sleep Is Disrupted

**Neurochemical rebalancing**
- Alcohol suppresses REM sleep - in recovery, REM rebounds (hence vivid dreams)
- GABA system is recalibrating (less natural calming, more activation)
- Melatonin production may be suppressed
- Cortisol patterns are disrupted

**Physical withdrawal**
- Body is adjusting to functioning without the substance
- Nervous system is hyperactive
- Night sweats, restlessness, discomfort

**Psychological factors**
- Anxiety about recovery
- Thoughts you previously numbed now have airtime
- Emotional processing that was avoided is happening
- Hypervigilance (common in trauma and recovery)

## Why Sleep Matters So Much

Poor sleep makes everything harder:
- Emotional regulation is impaired
- Cravings increase
- Irritability and mood instability
- Cognitive fog and poor decisions
- Immune function drops
- Physical recovery slows

This creates a dangerous cycle: poor sleep → harder recovery → more stress → poorer sleep.

Protecting sleep isn't optional - it's protective.

## What NOT to Do

**Don't replace one substance with another**
- Avoid sleep aids, alcohol (obviously), or other substances to knock yourself out
- Even over-the-counter options can create new dependencies
- "At least I'm not drinking" but now taking Benadryl every night isn't progress

**Don't catastrophise**
- "I'll never sleep normally again" isn't true
- Worrying about sleep makes sleep harder
- Bad nights happen - they're not the end of recovery

**Don't stay in bed awake for hours**
- This trains your brain that bed is for frustration, not sleep
- If you can't sleep after 20-30 minutes, get up and do something quiet until drowsy

## What Helps

**Sleep hygiene basics (boring but true):**
- Same wake time every day (even weekends)
- Bed only for sleep (and sex) - not screens, not worrying
- Cool, dark room
- Limit caffeine after noon
- Avoid heavy meals close to bedtime
- Wind-down routine in the hour before bed

**Managing the racing mind:**
- Write tomorrow's to-do list before bed (externalise the worries)
- Breathing exercises (4-7-8 breathing is particularly good for sleep)
- Body scan meditation
- Audiobooks or calm podcasts (not stimulating content)
- "Worry time" earlier in the day - designated time to process, not at bedtime

**Physical factors:**
- Exercise (but not too close to bedtime)
- Sunlight exposure during the day (helps regulate circadian rhythm)
- Limit fluids in evening (to reduce waking to urinate)
- Address physical discomfort (mattress, temperature, pain)

**Recovery-specific:**
- Evening meetings or support calls can help process the day
- Journaling before bed
- Gratitude practice (sounds cheesy, works)
- Letting go of the day - it's done, tomorrow is a new start

## Vivid Dreams and Nightmares

REM rebound is real. Your brain is catching up on dream sleep it was deprived of.

Common themes:
- Using dreams (dreaming you used, waking in panic)
- Anxiety dreams
- Processing trauma or memories
- Intense, cinematic, sometimes disturbing content

**Using dreams are normal.** They don't mean you want to use. They don't mean you're about to relapse. They're your brain processing. Many people in long-term recovery still occasionally have them.

What helps:
- Acknowledge the dream without giving it too much power
- Talk about it (sponsor, support group, therapist)
- Remind yourself it's processing, not prediction
- Notice if certain things trigger them (stress, particular content before bed)

## Timeline for Sleep Improvement

**Week 1-2:** Often the worst. Acute withdrawal affects sleep significantly.

**Weeks 2-4:** Gradual improvement but still disrupted. Dreams may be most vivid here.

**Months 1-3:** Sleep architecture starts normalising. Still some difficulties but trending better.

**Months 3-6:** Significant improvement for most people. Natural sleep starts returning.

**6 months+:** Continued normalisation. May still have occasional difficult nights but not the norm.

If severe sleep problems persist beyond several months, consider:
- Underlying sleep disorders (sleep apnea, restless legs)
- Mental health conditions (anxiety, depression)
- Talking to a doctor who understands recovery

## The Middle-of-the-Night Protocol

When you wake at 3am, mind racing, unable to get back to sleep:

1. Don't look at your phone (blue light, stimulation, time-checking anxiety)
2. Try a body scan or breathing exercise
3. If still awake after 20 minutes, get up
4. Do something quiet and non-stimulating (dim light, no screens)
5. Return to bed only when drowsy
6. Don't calculate how much sleep you're losing

And remember: one bad night doesn't ruin recovery. You've survived on poor sleep before. You'll survive this.

## When to Reference This

Use this framework when:
- Someone is struggling with sleep in early recovery
- They're anxious about disturbing dreams
- They're considering using something to help them sleep
- They're exhausted and it's affecting their recovery
- They want to know if this is normal and when it will improve
- They're having using dreams and worried what it means
- They need practical sleep strategies
