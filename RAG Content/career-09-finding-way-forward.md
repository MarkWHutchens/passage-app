# Finding Your Way Forward

## After the Ending

The old career is over. The grief (hopefully) is being processed. The immediate crisis (hopefully) is stabilising.

Now comes the question: what's next?

## The Pressure to Know

There's pressure - internal and external - to have an answer:
- "What are you going to do?"
- "Have you figured out your next move?"
- "What's the plan?"

This pressure can push you toward premature clarity. Grabbing at the first option to have something to say.

But sometimes "I don't know yet" is the honest and healthy answer.

## Exploration vs. Execution

**Execution mode:** You know what you want. You pursue it. Apply for jobs. Build the business. Follow the path.

**Exploration mode:** You don't know what you want. You're discovering. Trying things. Gathering information.

These require different approaches. Trying to execute when you should be exploring leads to ending up in the wrong place. Exploring when you should be executing leads to endless drifting.

Know which mode you're in.

## If You Know What You Want

Some people emerge from career transition with clarity. They know what's next, even if getting there is hard.

If that's you:
- Make a plan
- Take action
- Handle obstacles
- Keep moving forward

The challenge is execution, not direction.

## If You Don't Know What You Want

Many people don't know. The old path is gone but the new one isn't visible yet.

This is okay. Normal, even. But it requires a different approach.

### Get Curious

What interests you? What are you drawn to? What would you do if money weren't an issue?

Don't censor. Just notice.

### Gather Data

- Talk to people in fields that interest you
- Read about different paths
- Take assessments (Myers-Briggs, StrengthsFinder, etc.) - not as gospel, but as input
- Notice what energises and depletes you

### Experiment

- Take a class
- Do a short-term project
- Volunteer in a new area
- Try something small before committing big

Experiments provide information that thinking can't.

### Tolerate Uncertainty

Not knowing is uncomfortable. But it's also honest. Pretending to know when you don't leads to poor decisions.

Can you be in the question without forcing an answer?

### Watch for Patterns

As you explore, notice what keeps coming up:
- What topics do you keep reading about?
- What conversations energise you?
- What problems do you want to solve?
- What environments suit you?

The answers are often already there if you pay attention.

## Practical Considerations

Exploration is valuable but you also need to live. Balance idealism with pragmatism:

### Runway

How long can you afford to explore? Know your timeline.

### Bridge Options

You might need interim work while you figure things out. This isn't failure - it's smart. Pay the bills while you explore.

### Non-Negotiables

What must any option include? Income minimum? Location? Schedule? Know your constraints.

### Good Enough vs. Perfect

The perfect role may not exist or may not be findable right now. "Good enough for now" can be a stepping stone, not a life sentence.

## Common Traps

**Analysis paralysis:** Researching forever without acting. At some point, you have to try something.

**Comparison:** Everyone else seems to have it figured out. They don't. You're seeing their public narrative, not their private confusion.

**Waiting for passion:** "Find your passion" is unhelpful advice. Passion often develops through engagement, not before it.

**Perfectionism:** Looking for the perfect option instead of a good-enough starting point.

**Rushing:** Jumping at the first thing to escape uncertainty. Sometimes the right choice requires sitting with not-knowing a bit longer.

## The Path Unfolds

Here's a secret: most people's careers aren't linear plans that worked out. They're a series of choices, accidents, pivots, and discoveries.

You don't need to see the whole path. You just need to see the next step.

Take that step. See what happens. Adjust. Take another.

Over time, looking back, it will make a kind of sense it couldn't have made looking forward.

## When to Reference This

Use this framework when:
- Someone is in the "what's next" phase of career transition
- They don't know what they want
- They're feeling pressure to have answers
- They need permission to explore
- They're stuck in analysis paralysis
- They need to balance exploration with practical needs
- They need encouragement that the path will unfold
