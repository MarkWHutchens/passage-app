# Exercise: Feelings Check-In

## What This Is

A simple practice to identify what you're actually feeling. Sounds obvious, but many people struggle to name their emotions - they know something is wrong but can't pinpoint what.

This helps you get specific about your emotional state.

## When to Use It

- When you feel "off" but don't know why
- When emotions are vague or confusing
- At the start of a day or conversation
- When you're overwhelmed and need to sort through it
- As a regular emotional awareness practice

## The Check-In

Let's figure out what you're feeling right now.

Take a breath. Turn your attention inward.

### What's the Main Feeling?

Don't overthink it. What's the first thing that comes up?

Is it more like...

**Sad?** Down, heavy, grieving, disappointed, empty, melancholy?

**Anxious?** Worried, nervous, scared, on edge, panicky, unsettled?

**Angry?** Frustrated, irritated, resentful, furious, annoyed?

**Ashamed?** Embarrassed, guilty, humiliated, like you did something wrong?

**Numb?** Disconnected, flat, nothing, foggy, shut down?

**Okay?** Calm, neutral, content, fine?

**Good?** Happy, relieved, hopeful, grateful, peaceful?

What's closest?

### Get More Specific

Now let's go deeper. Within that category, what's the more precise feeling?

For example:
- "Anxious" might be specifically **dread** about something upcoming
- "Sad" might be specifically **lonely** 
- "Angry" might be specifically **hurt** underneath

What's the more specific word for what you're feeling?

### Where Is It in Your Body?

Emotions live in the body. Where do you feel this one?

- Chest tight?
- Stomach churning?
- Throat constricted?
- Shoulders tense?
- Heaviness somewhere?

Just notice. You don't have to change it.

### What Triggered It?

Do you know what set this off? 

It might be something that happened. A thought. A memory. A worry about the future. Something someone said. Or nothing you can identify.

You don't have to know. But if something comes up, notice it.

### What Does It Need?

Sometimes feelings are just there to be felt. But sometimes they point to a need.

- Sadness might need comfort or time
- Anxiety might need reassurance or action
- Anger might need acknowledgment or boundaries
- Loneliness might need connection

What might this feeling need from you?

## That's It

You've just checked in with yourself. You know more about what you're feeling than you did two minutes ago.

You don't have to fix anything right now. Naming and locating feelings is valuable on its own. It creates choice where there was just reaction.

## How Claude Should Guide This

- Move through the steps one at a time
- Give space for them to actually check in
- If they struggle to name it, offer options from the categories
- Don't interpret or analyze - just help them notice
- This is exploration, not therapy
- End by reflecting back what they discovered
