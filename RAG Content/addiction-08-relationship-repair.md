# Relationship Repair: Rebuilding Trust After Substance Use

## The Damage Is Real

You don't have to be an "addict" for your drinking or using to damage relationships. Any pattern of excessive use takes a toll on the people around you.

Maybe you're not physically dependent. Maybe you've never hit rock bottom. But if your partner has ever looked at you with that expression - disappointment, worry, resignation - you know what we're talking about.

Common damage from problematic use (not just addiction):
- Broken promises ("I'll only have two")
- Lies (hiding how much, hiding where you've been)
- Emotional unavailability (present but not really there)
- Unpredictability (never knowing which version of you is coming home)
- Financial strain (it adds up)
- Neglected responsibilities (things falling through the cracks)
- Eroded trust (small betrayals accumulate)
- Hurt caused while intoxicated (words you can't take back)
- Lost time and experiences (physically present, mentally absent)
- Worry and anxiety in loved ones (they carry it even if you don't see it)

The damage exists on a spectrum, just like the use itself. Someone whose partner drinks too much every weekend is hurt differently than someone whose partner is in active addiction - but both are hurt.

Before you can repair, you need to acknowledge - to yourself and others - that the damage is real. Even if you think "it wasn't that bad."

## Why Repair Matters

**For your recovery:**
- Unaddressed guilt and shame fuel continued use
- Isolation is dangerous; repaired relationships provide support
- Making amends is part of the healing process
- Living with the wreckage without addressing it keeps you stuck

**For others:**
- They deserve acknowledgment
- They deserve the opportunity to heal
- They may need to see change, not just hear promises

**For the relationship itself:**
- Some relationships can be rebuilt stronger
- Others may end, but can end with dignity
- The process matters even if the outcome is uncertain

## Not All Relationships Should Be Saved

This is hard to hear, but:
- Some relationships were toxic before the substance use became a problem
- Some people enabled the behaviour
- Some damage may be too great
- Some relationships require you to remain in harmful situations

Repair doesn't mean fixing everything. Sometimes it means accepting endings gracefully and making amends without expecting reconciliation.

## The Order of Operations

**1. Stabilise your own behaviour first**

You can't repair relationships while actively using problematically or in crisis. Get some stability under your belt. If you're dealing with serious dependence, most advice suggests waiting 6-12 months before making major amends (though this doesn't mean zero contact - it means don't rush the big conversations).

**2. Work on yourself**

What patterns led here? What do you need to change? Stopping or cutting back is the minimum - growing as a person is the goal. This usually requires honest self-examination, and often therapy or support groups.

**3. Living amends before spoken amends**

"Living amends" means showing change through consistent behaviour. Words without changed behaviour mean nothing to people who've heard a thousand promises.

- Show up when you say you will
- Do what you say you'll do
- Be present and sober
- Handle responsibilities
- Stop lying (even small lies)

**4. Direct amends when appropriate**

Eventually, for significant relationships and harms, direct conversation may be needed. This is different from apologising to make yourself feel better - it's taking responsibility for harm caused.

## How to Make Amends (Not Just Apologise)

**Apology:** "I'm sorry I hurt you."
**Amends:** "I acknowledge the specific harm I caused, I take responsibility for it, I'm working to change, and I'm asking what I can do to repair."

Components of genuine amends:
- **Specific acknowledgment:** Name what you did, not vague generalities
- **No excuses:** Not "I was drunk" or "but you also..."
- **Taking responsibility:** "I did this" not "mistakes were made"
- **Understanding impact:** Show you understand how it affected them
- **Commitment to change:** What are you doing differently?
- **Asking what they need:** Not dictating what forgiveness looks like

Important: Some amends should not be made directly if doing so would cause more harm. If your amends would devastate someone (revealing affairs, etc.), consult a sponsor or therapist first.

## What to Expect

**You will not be trusted immediately.** Trust is rebuilt in small increments over extended time. You may feel frustrated - "I've been doing better for 3 months, why don't they trust me?" Three months is nothing compared to years of broken trust.

**They may not forgive you.** Forgiveness is their choice, not your entitlement. You make amends regardless of the outcome.

**Their anger is legitimate.** Even if you've changed, they're allowed to still be hurt, angry, scared. Don't expect them to be over it because you're doing better now.

**They may test you.** People who've been burned watch carefully for signs of old patterns. This can feel unfair. It's understandable.

**Some relationships won't survive.** This is painful but sometimes true. You grieve this, but you don't use over it.

## Rebuilding Trust: The Timeline

Trust is rebuilt through:
- **Consistency** (doing what you say, over and over)
- **Time** (months and years, not days and weeks)
- **Transparency** (being open, not secretive)
- **Accountability** (admitting when you mess up, even small things)
- **Changed behaviour** (not just abstinence - actual growth)

No shortcuts. No accelerating. Just steady accumulation of evidence that you're different now.

## With Partners/Spouses

Intimate relationships carry unique damage and complexity:
- They may have developed codependent patterns
- They may have their own trauma from the relationship
- They may need their own support/therapy
- Physical and emotional intimacy may need to be rebuilt slowly
- Old dynamics don't automatically change because you've changed your behaviour

Consider couples therapy with someone who understands substance use issues. Both partners usually need individual support too.

## With Children

If your substance use affected your children:
- Age-appropriate honesty matters
- Children often know more than you think
- Your changes benefit them regardless of your relationship status
- Consistency is everything - showing up matters more than big gestures
- They may have their own anger, confusion, grief
- Family therapy can help
- You can't undo the past, but you can be present now

## With Parents/Family of Origin

Complex because:
- Family systems may have contributed to addiction
- Boundaries may be necessary
- Some family members may still enable or undermine
- Old roles and patterns run deep

Recovery sometimes means changing your role in the family system, which can meet resistance. Stay focused on your own recovery while working on these relationships.

## When Repair Isn't Possible

Sometimes people have died, disappeared, or made clear they want no contact.

Options:
- Written amends (letter you may never send)
- Symbolic amends (donating to causes, helping others)
- Living amends (being the person you wish you'd been)
- Acceptance (some things can't be undone)

## When to Reference This

Use this framework when:
- Someone is struggling with damaged relationships
- They want to make amends but don't know how
- They're frustrated that trust isn't rebuilding faster
- They're deciding whether to reach out to someone they hurt
- They're dealing with a partner who's struggling to forgive
- They want to repair relationship with children
- They're receiving pushback from family despite making changes
- They need to accept that some relationships are over
- They think "it wasn't that bad" but are sensing relationship strain
