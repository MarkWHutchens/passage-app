# What Burnout Actually Is

## More Than Being Tired

Everyone gets tired. Everyone has stressful periods. Burnout is different.

Burnout is what happens when prolonged stress depletes you beyond your capacity to recover. It's not a bad week. It's a systematic breakdown of your ability to function in an area of life - usually work, but it can happen in caregiving, parenting, relationships, or any sustained demanding role.

## The Three Dimensions

Research (particularly Christina Maslach's work) identifies three core components of burnout:

### 1. Exhaustion

Not just physical tiredness - though that's part of it. This is:
- Emotional exhaustion (nothing left to give)
- Mental exhaustion (can't think clearly)
- Physical exhaustion (bone-deep fatigue that sleep doesn't fix)

You wake up tired. Weekends don't restore you. Holidays provide temporary relief but the exhaustion returns immediately.

### 2. Cynicism / Detachment

A protective withdrawal from the thing that's burning you out:
- Caring less about work you used to care about
- Emotional distancing from colleagues, clients, patients
- Negativity and pessimism about the job or organisation
- Going through motions without engagement
- "Why bother?" thinking

This isn't laziness. It's your psyche protecting itself from continued depletion.

### 3. Reduced Effectiveness

Even when you try, you can't perform like you used to:
- Productivity drops
- Quality suffers
- Simple tasks feel overwhelming
- Decision-making impaired
- Creativity gone
- Mistakes increase

This often creates a vicious cycle: you're less effective, so you work longer, which depletes you more, which makes you less effective.

## How Burnout Develops

Burnout rarely happens overnight. It's progressive:

**Stage 1: Honeymoon**
- High energy, high commitment
- Taking on too much but managing
- May ignore early warning signs
- Often driven by enthusiasm or necessity

**Stage 2: Stress Onset**
- Some days harder than others
- Fatigue becoming noticeable
- Irritability increasing
- Sleep or appetite changes
- Still functioning but straining

**Stage 3: Chronic Stress**
- Exhaustion becoming persistent
- Cynicism creeping in
- Performance noticeably affected
- Physical symptoms (illness, headaches, etc.)
- Social withdrawal beginning
- Resentment building

**Stage 4: Burnout**
- All three dimensions present
- Unable to function normally
- May feel empty, hopeless
- Physical health often impacted
- Considering drastic changes (quitting, major life shifts)

**Stage 5: Habitual Burnout**
- Burnout becomes embedded
- Chronic mental and physical problems
- May not remember feeling different
- Significant intervention needed

Most people don't notice until Stage 3 or 4. The earlier you catch it, the easier recovery is.

## What Burnout Is Not

**Not weakness.** High performers burn out. Dedicated people burn out. It's often the most committed who are most vulnerable.

**Not laziness.** Burnout happens TO people who work hard, not to people avoiding work.

**Not just "stress."** Stress is pressure. Burnout is what happens when pressure exceeds recovery for too long. You can have high stress without burnout if you have adequate recovery.

**Not a personal failing.** Burnout is usually a systems problem - too much demand, too few resources, poor boundaries, unsustainable expectations. Individual resilience can't compensate indefinitely for systemic issues.

## Who Burns Out

Anyone, but some factors increase risk:
- Helping professions (healthcare, teaching, social work)
- High-pressure industries (finance, law, tech)
- Caregivers (professional or family)
- Perfectionists and high achievers
- People who tie identity to work
- Those with poor boundaries
- People in toxic or dysfunctional environments
- Those without adequate support

## The Cost

Burnout costs:
- Health (physical and mental)
- Relationships (withdrawn, irritable, unavailable)
- Career (impaired performance, sometimes quitting)
- Identity (who am I without work?)
- Years (recovery takes time)

It's not something to push through. The cost of ignoring it exceeds the cost of addressing it.

## When to Reference This

Use this framework when:
- Someone is questioning whether they're "really" burned out
- They think they're just tired or stressed
- They're blaming themselves for not coping
- They need to understand what's happening to them
- They're in early stages and need to recognise it
- They're in late stages and need validation
- They're minimising the seriousness
