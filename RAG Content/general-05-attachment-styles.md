# Attachment Styles: How Early Relationships Shape Us

## What Is Attachment?

Attachment theory explains how our earliest relationships shape how we connect with others throughout life.

As infants, we're completely dependent on caregivers. Our survival depends on staying connected to them. The patterns we develop to maintain that connection become templates for all future relationships.

Understanding your attachment style helps explain:
- Why you react the way you do in relationships
- What triggers your anxiety or withdrawal
- Patterns that keep repeating
- What you need to feel secure

## The Four Styles

### Secure Attachment

**How it develops:**
Caregivers were consistently responsive, attuned, and available. You learned that relationships are safe, people are reliable, and it's okay to depend on others.

**What it looks like in adulthood:**
- Comfortable with intimacy and independence
- Can ask for what you need
- Trust comes relatively easily
- Handle conflict without falling apart
- Don't take relationship bumps as catastrophes
- Can be alone without anxiety
- Can be close without losing yourself

**The internal model:**
"I'm worthy of love. Others are trustworthy. Relationships are safe."

### Anxious Attachment (Anxious-Preoccupied)

**How it develops:**
Caregivers were inconsistent - sometimes available, sometimes not. You learned to be hypervigilant about connection, never sure if it would be there.

**What it looks like in adulthood:**
- Crave closeness but fear abandonment
- Need lots of reassurance
- Sensitive to signs of rejection
- May seem "clingy" or "needy"
- Anxiety spikes when connection feels threatened
- May sacrifice yourself to maintain relationships
- Difficulty with partner's independence
- Preoccupied with relationship status

**The internal model:**
"I'm not sure I'm worthy of love. I need to work hard to keep people close. Abandonment is always possible."

### Avoidant Attachment (Dismissive-Avoidant)

**How it develops:**
Caregivers were emotionally unavailable or rejecting. You learned to suppress needs and rely only on yourself.

**What it looks like in adulthood:**
- Value independence highly
- Uncomfortable with too much closeness
- May seem emotionally distant
- Suppress or minimize needs
- Pull away when things get intense
- Pride yourself on not needing others
- Discomfort with emotional intimacy
- May seem detached in crisis

**The internal model:**
"I don't need anyone. Depending on others leads to disappointment. I'm fine on my own."

### Disorganised Attachment (Fearful-Avoidant)

**How it develops:**
Caregivers were frightening OR frightened - the source of comfort was also a source of fear. Creates an unsolvable dilemma.

**What it looks like in adulthood:**
- Want closeness but fear it
- Push-pull dynamics in relationships
- May sabotage good relationships
- Intense emotional reactions
- Difficulty trusting
- May dissociate in relational stress
- Unpredictable in intimacy
- Often linked to early trauma

**The internal model:**
"I want love but it's dangerous. People hurt you. I don't know how to do this safely."

## These Are Tendencies, Not Destinies

**Important points:**

- Most people are not purely one style - we have tendencies
- You may be secure with some people, activated with others
- Context matters (stress increases insecurity)
- Styles can change over time with awareness and effort
- You're not broken - these patterns made sense when they developed

## How Styles Interact

Different attachment styles trigger each other:

**Anxious + Avoidant:** Classic push-pull. The anxious person pursues; the avoidant withdraws. Pursuit increases; withdrawal increases. Both are stuck.

**Anxious + Anxious:** Can feel intense and validating but may amplify fears rather than soothe them.

**Avoidant + Avoidant:** May seem stable but lack depth. Neither pushes for connection.

**Secure + Anyone:** Secure partners tend to have a regulating effect. Their steadiness can help others feel safer.

## What Activates Insecurity

For **anxious** attachment:
- Partner seeming distant
- Delayed responses
- Perceived rejection
- Partner's independence
- Uncertainty about where you stand

For **avoidant** attachment:
- Too much demand for closeness
- Emotional intensity
- Being needed/depended upon
- Loss of space or independence
- Pressure to open up

For **disorganised** attachment:
- Intimacy itself
- Conflict
- Vulnerability
- Being seen
- Both closeness and distance can trigger

## Moving Toward Security

Attachment styles aren't permanent. You can "earn" security through:

### Self-awareness
Understanding your patterns, triggers, and tendencies. This alone creates choice where there was reactivity.

### Safe relationships
Consistent, reliable relationships (including with therapists) can build new templates.

### Healing underlying wounds
Therapy, especially attachment-focused or trauma-focused, can address root causes.

### Practice
Consciously acting differently in relationships. Tolerating discomfort. Communicating needs.

### Self-compassion
Your attachment style developed for good reasons. It kept you connected to caregivers who weren't perfect. Judging yourself for it doesn't help.

## When to Reference This

Use this framework when:
- Someone keeps repeating relationship patterns
- They're confused by their reactions in relationships
- They're triggered by partner's behaviour in ways that seem disproportionate
- They want to understand their relational tendencies
- They're in a push-pull dynamic
- They want to work toward more secure relating
