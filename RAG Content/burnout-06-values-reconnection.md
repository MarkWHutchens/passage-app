# Reconnecting With Values: What Actually Matters

## When Work Lost Meaning

Part of burnout is often losing connection to why you do what you do.

Maybe you went into your field with purpose. To help people. To create things. To solve problems. To make a difference.

Then somewhere along the way, the purpose got buried under:
- Bureaucracy and admin
- Metrics and targets
- Politics and dysfunction
- Exhaustion and survival mode

You forgot why you started. Or you started questioning whether it was ever worth it.

## Why Values Matter

Values are what matter to you. Not what should matter. Not what others say matters. What actually, genuinely, matters to you.

Living aligned with values creates meaning, even when life is hard.
Living misaligned with values creates emptiness, even when life looks successful.

Burnout often involves value misalignment:
- Doing work that doesn't reflect what matters to you
- Sacrificing important values (health, relationships, integrity) for work
- Losing touch with your "why"

Recovery often requires reconnecting with values and realigning life accordingly.

## Finding Your Values

### What Mattered Before?

Think back to before the burnout, before this job, maybe back to earlier in life:
- What lit you up?
- When did work feel meaningful?
- What were you hoping to do with your career?
- What kind of person did you want to be?

### What Do You Miss?

In your current depleted state:
- What do you miss most about your old self?
- What relationships or activities have you neglected?
- What would you do if you had energy?
- What parts of life feel empty?

### What Makes You Angry?

Strong reactions often point to values:
- What bothers you most about your workplace?
- What feels wrong about how you're living?
- What would you change if you could?

### Common Values

Not exhaustive, but to prompt your thinking:
- **Connection:** relationships, family, community, belonging
- **Health:** physical wellbeing, mental health, vitality
- **Creativity:** making things, expression, innovation
- **Growth:** learning, development, becoming better
- **Service:** helping others, contribution, impact
- **Integrity:** honesty, alignment, authenticity
- **Freedom:** autonomy, choice, independence
- **Security:** stability, safety, predictability
- **Adventure:** novelty, exploration, risk
- **Achievement:** accomplishment, mastery, success
- **Balance:** harmony, sustainability, wholeness

Which resonate? Which have been neglected?

## The Misalignment Problem

Burnout often involves living out of alignment with values:

**Sacrificing health for achievement.** You value health, but you've been running yourself into the ground.

**Sacrificing relationships for work.** You value connection, but you're never present with the people you love.

**Sacrificing integrity for approval.** You value honesty, but you've been pretending everything's fine.

**Sacrificing meaning for money.** You value contribution, but you're doing work that feels empty.

No amount of success in what doesn't matter can compensate for failure in what does.

## Realigning

Recovery involves asking: how do I bring my life back into alignment with what matters?

### Short-term

While you're still recovering:
- Small actions aligned with values (call a friend, take a walk, create something small)
- Protect values that are non-negotiable (sleep, health, key relationships)
- Notice when you're acting against values

### Medium-term

As you stabilise:
- Evaluate your work: can it align with values, or is misalignment inherent?
- Make changes where possible (role, responsibilities, approach)
- Build values into daily life, not just as occasional treats

### Long-term

The bigger questions:
- Is this career right for me?
- What would values-aligned work look like?
- What changes would bring my life into alignment?
- What trade-offs am I willing to make?

## When the Job Can't Align

Sometimes values clarification reveals that the problem isn't you - it's the fit.

The job may be:
- Fundamentally misaligned with your values
- Incompatible with sustainable living
- Unable to offer what matters to you

This is painful but useful information. It's better to know than to keep trying to make something work that can't.

## Values vs. Obligations

Values are not the same as obligations. You may feel obligated to work certain hours, earn certain money, meet certain expectations.

But obligations don't create meaning. You can fulfil all your obligations and still feel empty.

The question is: what do you genuinely value, and how much of your life reflects that?

## When to Reference This

Use this framework when:
- Someone has lost sense of meaning or purpose
- They're questioning whether their work matters
- They're living out of alignment with what's important to them
- They're recovering and trying to figure out what's next
- They need help identifying what actually matters to them
- They're considering major changes (career, life direction)
- They're realising the problem is fit, not just stress
