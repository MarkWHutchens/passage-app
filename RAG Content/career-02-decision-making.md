# Making Decisions When You Don't Know What's Next

## The Uncertainty Problem

Career transition often means making decisions without knowing how they'll turn out.

Should you take this job or wait for something better? Retrain or leverage existing skills? Play it safe or take a risk? Start your own thing or find another employer?

You want certainty. You want to know the right answer. But certainty isn't available.

## Why Career Decisions Are Hard

**High stakes.** This affects income, identity, daily life, family. It matters.

**Incomplete information.** You can't fully know what a job will be like until you're in it. You can't predict the economy or your industry.

**Competing values.** Money vs. meaning. Security vs. growth. Family needs vs. career ambitions. There's rarely a choice that maximises everything.

**Emotional noise.** Fear, grief, anxiety, excitement - all of these affect judgment. It's hard to think clearly when you're activated.

**Identity involvement.** This isn't just a practical decision. It's about who you are and who you're becoming.

## What Doesn't Work

**Waiting for certainty.** It won't come. Waiting for perfect clarity often means not deciding at all.

**Pros and cons lists alone.** They help, but they don't capture what really matters. A decision can win on paper and feel completely wrong.

**Asking everyone's opinion.** You'll get contradictory advice and end up more confused. Others don't have to live with your choice.

**Deciding from fear.** Fear distorts judgment. Decisions made purely to avoid scary outcomes often lead to regret.

**Perfectionism.** There's no perfect choice. Every option has trade-offs. Searching for the flawless path keeps you stuck.

## What Helps

### Get Clear on Values

What actually matters to you? Not what should matter. What does.

- Financial security?
- Autonomy and flexibility?
- Impact and meaning?
- Learning and growth?
- Work-life balance?
- Status and recognition?
- Creative expression?
- Stability?

Rank them honestly. When values conflict (and they will), which wins?

### Separate Needs from Wants

**Needs:** What you genuinely require. Health insurance. Minimum income. Reasonable hours.

**Wants:** What you'd prefer. Dream salary. Perfect culture. Ideal location.

Know the difference. Don't sacrifice needs for wants. But also don't reject good options because they're not perfect.

### Consider the Worst Case

For each option:
- What's the realistic worst case?
- Could you survive it?
- Could you recover from it?
- How likely is it?

Often the worst case is more survivable than fear suggests. And sometimes examining it reveals that an option is genuinely too risky.

### Use Time Horizons

How does this decision look:
- In 1 month?
- In 1 year?
- In 5 years?
- In 10 years?

Short-term pain (learning curve, less pay, uncertainty) might be worth long-term gain. Or short-term security might be worth taking now while you stabilise.

### Listen to Your Body

When you imagine taking each path:
- What happens in your body?
- Expansion or contraction?
- Energy or depletion?
- Relief or dread?

The body often knows before the mind does. This isn't the only input, but it's valuable data.

### Small Tests Where Possible

Before committing fully:
- Can you try it part-time?
- Can you shadow someone in that role?
- Can you take a short contract before permanent?
- Can you talk to people doing what you're considering?

Gather real-world data when possible.

### Accept Imperfection

No decision will be perfect. Every path has costs. You're not choosing between good and bad - you're choosing between trade-offs.

Make the best decision you can with what you know now. If it turns out to be wrong, you can adjust. Very few career decisions are truly irreversible.

## The Decision Itself

At some point, you have to choose. Not choosing is also a choice - usually to stay stuck.

- Gather enough information (not all possible information)
- Consult the right people (not everyone)
- Check with your values, your body, your gut
- Make the call
- Commit to it without constantly second-guessing

You can't know if it's right until you live it. That's the nature of decisions.

## After Deciding

- Stop relitigating. The decision is made.
- Give it a fair chance before evaluating
- Notice if you're looking for evidence it was wrong
- Adjust if needed, but not reflexively
- Trust that you can handle whatever comes

## When to Reference This

Use this framework when:
- Someone is paralysed by career decisions
- They're waiting for certainty that won't come
- They're overwhelmed by options
- They're making fear-based decisions
- They need a framework for thinking through choices
- They've made a decision and are second-guessing constantly
