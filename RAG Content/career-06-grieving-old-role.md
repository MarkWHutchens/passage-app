# Grieving the Old Role

## It Deserves a Funeral

Whether you left by choice or were pushed out, whether you hated it or loved it - your old career deserves to be properly grieved.

Without grieving what was, you carry it into what's next. Unprocessed endings contaminate new beginnings.

## What You're Grieving

### The Identity

"I was a teacher." "I was an engineer." "I was a managing director."

This wasn't just what you did. It was how you answered "what do you do?" - which really means "who are you?" Losing that answer is disorienting.

### The Competence

In your old role, you knew what you were doing. You had skills, knowledge, reputation. You'd earned your place.

Now you're starting over. The mastery you built doesn't fully transfer. You're a beginner again.

### The People

Colleagues, clients, patients, students - whoever populated your work world. Daily interactions you may have taken for granted. A community, even if imperfect.

### The Routine

The rhythm of your days. The commute (even if you hated it). The morning coffee. The familiar patterns. Structure you didn't have to think about.

### The Future You Expected

Maybe you had a path in mind. Promotion. Partnership. Retirement from this role. A vision of where you were headed that's now obsolete.

### The Good Parts

Even bad jobs have good parts. Moments of satisfaction. Problems solved. Contributions made. Students who learned. Patients who healed. Projects completed.

## The Complicated Grief

Career grief is often complicated because it's mixed:

**Relief AND sadness.** You're glad to be out AND you miss it.

**Anger AND nostalgia.** You resent how it ended AND you remember the good times.

**Failure AND accomplishment.** You feel you failed somehow AND you know you achieved things.

**Clarity AND confusion.** You know it was time to go AND you're not sure what to do now.

This mix is normal. You can hold contradictory feelings. They don't cancel each other out.

## If You Loved It

Grieving work you loved is straightforward in some ways - of course you're sad. But it can feel self-indulgent. "It was just a job. I should be over it."

It wasn't just a job if you loved it. It was meaningful. It was part of you. Grief is appropriate.

## If You Hated It

Grieving work you hated is confusing. Why mourn something you wanted to leave?

Because even miserable situations become familiar. Because parts of you adapted to it. Because change is hard regardless of direction. Because there were probably good things mixed with the bad.

You're not grieving for what it was. You're grieving the ending, the disruption, the familiar-even-if-painful that's now gone.

## The Unfinished Business

Some career grief is about what wasn't:
- The promotion you never got
- The recognition you deserved and didn't receive
- The potential unrealised
- The things you wanted to do but couldn't
- The person you could have become there

This is grief for the unlived career - the parallel path that didn't happen.

## How to Grieve

### Acknowledge It

Name the loss. Say it out loud. "I'm grieving my career." This isn't dramatic - it's honest.

### Tell the Story

Talk about it. Write about it. Process what happened, what it meant, what you're leaving behind.

### Feel What Comes Up

Sadness, anger, relief, confusion - let it move through rather than stuffing it down.

### Mark the Ending

Rituals help. Write a letter to your old role. Have a symbolic goodbye. Do something that marks the transition.

### Extract the Gifts

What did you learn? What skills did you develop? What do you want to carry forward? What do you want to leave behind?

### Thank It

Even if it ended badly. Even if you're glad it's over. That role was part of your life. It shaped you. It brought you to now.

Gratitude, even complicated gratitude, helps release the past.

## Moving On

Grieving isn't wallowing. The goal is to process and release so you can move forward unencumbered.

Signs you're moving through:
- You can talk about it without emotional flooding
- You can see both good and bad clearly
- You're more focused on future than past
- The old role takes up less mental space
- You're building a new sense of identity

This takes time. Don't rush it. But do keep moving.

## When to Reference This

Use this framework when:
- Someone is struggling to let go of their old career
- They're confused about missing something they wanted to leave
- They're not acknowledging the loss (rushing to "what's next")
- They're stuck in grief about work and need to move through it
- They need permission to mourn a job
- They're carrying anger or sadness that's contaminating their present
