# Exercise: What Went Well

## What This Is

A daily reflection practice from positive psychology research (Martin Seligman). Each day, you identify three things that went well AND explore why they went well.

The key difference from simple gratitude: this focuses on what went well and your role in it - building a sense of agency, not just appreciation.

## When to Use It

- As a daily evening practice
- When you feel ineffective or helpless
- When you're only noticing what's going wrong
- To build optimism and sense of agency over time
- When depression makes everything feel like failure

## Why It Works

The brain has a negativity bias - it notices problems more than successes. This made sense for survival but creates suffering now.

What Went Well deliberately trains attention toward:
- What's actually working
- Your role in making things work
- Causes of good events (not just luck)

Research shows doing this daily for just one week increases happiness and decreases depression - effects lasting months.

## The Practice

Think about your day (or yesterday if it's morning).

We're looking for three things that went well. They don't have to be big. Small wins count. Ordinary moments count.

For each one, we'll explore three questions:
1. What does this mean to me?
2. How did this come about?
3. How do I get more of this good thing in my life?

### First: What Went Well?

What's one thing that went well today?

It might be:
- A conversation that went smoothly
- A task you completed
- A moment of connection
- Something you handled well
- A problem that got solved
- A small pleasure
- Something you avoided or prevented

What comes to mind?

---

**What does this mean to you?**

Why does this matter? What makes it significant, even if it seems small?

---

**How did this come about?**

What caused it to happen? Was it something you did? A choice you made? Something about the circumstances? What contributed?

---

**How could you get more of this good thing in your life?**

What would it take to have more moments like this? Is there something you could do, choose, or set up?

---

### Second: What Else Went Well?

What's another thing that went well?

Try a different category - if the first was work, maybe this one is personal. If the first was big, maybe this one is small.

---

**What does this mean to you?**

---

**How did this come about?**

---

**How could you get more of it?**

---

### Third: One More Thing

What's a third thing that went well?

Even small. Even ordinary. What else?

---

**What does this mean to you?**

---

**How did this come about?**

---

**How could you get more of it?**

---

## Reflect

Notice what you found.

Three things went well. You've explored why they matter, how they happened, and how to cultivate more.

This doesn't erase what went badly. But it balances the picture - and points toward what you can build on.

## Making It a Practice

This works best as a daily habit:

**When:** Evening works well - reflecting on the day
**How long:** 5-10 minutes
**Written vs. mental:** Writing deepens the effect, but mental works too
**Duration:** Try it for one week. Notice what shifts.

The compound effect matters. One day is nice. A week starts to rewire attention patterns.

## The Three Questions Matter

Don't skip the follow-up questions. Each one does something different:

**"What does this mean to me?"** - Connects the event to your values and what matters. Makes it personal.

**"How did this come about?"** - Builds understanding of cause. Helps you see your role and what conditions create good outcomes.

**"How do I get more of this?"** - Turns reflection into action. Moves from noticing to building.

Together, they transform a nice moment into insight you can use.

## When It's Hard

Some days nothing feels like it went well. On those days:

- Lower the bar dramatically ("I got out of bed")
- Look for neutral things that could have gone worse but didn't
- Notice tiny moments ("The coffee was good")
- Acknowledge the day was hard AND find three small things

The practice is especially valuable on hard days - that's when the rebalancing matters most.

## How Claude Should Guide This

- Go through three things one at a time
- For each thing, ask all three questions before moving to the next
- If they struggle with "what does this mean," help them connect it to what they care about
- If they struggle with "how to get more," brainstorm possibilities together
- Reflect back what they found at the end
- Suggest making it a daily practice
