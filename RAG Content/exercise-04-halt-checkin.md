# Exercise: HALT Check-In

## What This Is

HALT stands for Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired. These four states make everything harder - worse mood, less resilience, more vulnerability to cravings or poor decisions.

This is a quick check-in to see if one of these basic needs is affecting you right now.

## When to Use It

- When you're feeling off and don't know why
- When you're struggling and need to troubleshoot
- Before making important decisions
- When cravings or urges are strong
- As a regular daily check-in
- When emotions feel bigger than the situation warrants

## The Check-In

Let's go through each one. Answer honestly.

---

### H - Hungry?

When did you last eat?

Is your body asking for food right now? Stomach growling? Light-headed? Irritable in that "I need food" way?

Low blood sugar affects mood, decision-making, and willpower dramatically.

**If yes:** Eat something. Even something small. Check in again after.

---

### A - Angry?

Are you carrying any anger right now? Frustration? Resentment? Irritation?

It doesn't have to be rage. Even low-level annoyance counts.

Is there something bothering you that you haven't addressed? Something unfair that happened? Someone who let you down?

**If yes:** Name it. Acknowledge it. You don't have to fix it right now, but recognize it's there and affecting you.

### L - Lonely?

When did you last connect with another person in a meaningful way?

Are you feeling isolated? Disconnected? Like no one understands?

Loneliness isn't just about being alone - you can be surrounded by people and still feel lonely.

**If yes:** Reach out to someone. Even a text. Even a brief call. Connection helps.

---

### T - Tired?

How did you sleep last night? How's your energy right now?

Are you running on empty? Pushing through exhaustion? Been going too hard for too long?

Fatigue undermines everything - emotional regulation, judgment, patience, resilience.

**If yes:** Rest if you can. If you can't rest right now, at least don't make big decisions while depleted.

## What Did You Find?

Which ones came up for you?

Sometimes it's one thing. Sometimes it's multiple. Sometimes just identifying "oh, I'm tired and hungry" explains why everything feels so hard right now.

**The action:** Address the basic need first. Then reassess. Often, what felt like a crisis is more manageable once you've eaten, rested, connected, or processed some anger.

## Making It a Practice

You can use HALT as a regular check-in:
- Morning: How am I starting the day?
- When struggling: Is one of these affecting me?
- Before big decisions: Am I in a good state to choose?
- Evening: What do I need before bed?

It takes 30 seconds and often reveals what's actually going on.

## How Claude Should Guide This

- Go through each letter one at a time
- Pause for them to actually check in with themselves
- If they identify something, acknowledge it and suggest a simple action
- At the end, reflect back what they found
- This is practical troubleshooting, not deep therapy
