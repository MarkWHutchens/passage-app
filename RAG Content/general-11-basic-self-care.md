# Basic Self-Care When You're Struggling

## The Fundamentals

When you're going through something hard, elaborate self-care routines are unrealistic. But basic physical needs become MORE important, not less.

This isn't about spa days or treating yourself. It's about the bare minimum your body needs to function.

## Why Basics Matter

When you're depleted:
- Skipping meals worsens mood
- Poor sleep amplifies everything
- Dehydration affects cognition
- Neglecting hygiene compounds shame
- Physical neglect deepens depression

Taking care of basics doesn't fix the underlying problem. But it keeps you functional while you address it.

## The Non-Negotiables

### 1. Eat Something

**When you don't want to:**
- You don't have to eat well. Just eat.
- Small amounts are fine
- Easy food is fine (cereal, toast, crackers)
- Don't skip meals even if you have no appetite
- Blood sugar affects mood dramatically

**Minimum:** Something every few hours. Doesn't matter what.

**If you can do more:** Protein and vegetables. Regular meals. Reduce sugar spikes.

### 2. Drink Water

**When you forget:**
- Keep water visible
- Drink a glass first thing in morning
- Dehydration causes headaches, fatigue, irritability

**Minimum:** Enough that your urine is light colored.

**Note:** Coffee and alcohol don't count. They dehydrate.

### 3. Sleep

**When it's hard:**
- Keep regular sleep/wake times
- Dark, cool room
- No screens before bed
- See the sleep article for more

**Minimum:** Get in bed for 7-8 hours even if sleep is broken.

**This is the most important one.** Almost everything is harder without sleep.

### 4. Move Your Body

**When you have no energy:**
- A short walk counts
- Stretching counts
- Going outside for 5 minutes counts
- You don't need to exercise - just move

**Minimum:** Some movement daily, even brief.

**Why it matters:** Movement affects mood, energy, sleep, and regulation.

### 5. Basic Hygiene

**When you can't face it:**
- Shower or at least wash face
- Brush teeth
- Change clothes
- These small acts affect self-perception

**Minimum:** Whatever keeps you from spiraling into neglect.

**Note:** If you haven't showered in days, that's a sign things are serious.

### 6. Get Outside

**When you want to hide:**
- Even briefly
- Daylight affects mood and sleep
- Nature is regulating
- Breaking isolation helps

**Minimum:** Step outside once a day, even for a minute.

### 7. Human Contact

**When you want to withdraw:**
- Isolation makes everything worse
- You don't have to talk about what's wrong
- Brief contact counts
- Text if calls are too hard

**Minimum:** Some contact with another human daily, even small.

## The Bare Minimum Day

When you can barely function, aim for:
- Eat something (anything)
- Drink water
- Get to bed on time
- Brief movement (walk to mailbox)
- Shower or wash face
- Step outside
- One text or call

That's it. That's a successful day when you're in survival mode.

## When Even This Is Too Much

Sometimes even basics feel impossible. That's okay.

**Do what you can:**
- One thing is better than zero
- Prioritize sleep if you can only do one thing
- Lower the bar further (lie down if you can't sleep, rinse off if you can't shower)
- Accept where you are

**Get help:**
- If you can't feed yourself, tell someone
- If you're not sleeping at all, tell someone
- If basic functioning has collapsed, you may need more support

## What Doesn't Count as Self-Care

When struggling, be careful about:

**Alcohol or drugs** - These feel like coping but usually make things worse.

**Numbing behaviors** - Endless scrolling, bingeing TV, overeating. Brief escape is fine; hours of avoidance isn't self-care.

**Isolation** - Staying in bed all day isn't rest; it's withdrawal.

**Overworking** - Staying busy to avoid feelings isn't self-care.

## Self-Care vs. Self-Soothing

**Self-care:** Actions that support your wellbeing (sleep, nutrition, movement).

**Self-soothing:** Actions that feel good in the moment (comfort food, rest, distraction).

Both have their place. But don't mistake self-soothing for self-care. Sometimes you need both.

## Building Back Up

As you stabilize, you can add:
- More nutritious food
- Regular exercise
- Better sleep hygiene
- Enjoyable activities
- Social connection
- Things that give you meaning

But start with basics. Build from there.

## When to Reference This

Use this framework when:
- Someone is struggling with basic functioning
- They're neglecting physical needs while in crisis
- They need permission to lower the bar
- They need a simple checklist for surviving hard periods
- They're confusing numbing with self-care
- They're ready to start rebuilding basics
