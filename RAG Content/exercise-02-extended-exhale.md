# Exercise: Extended Exhale Breathing

## What This Is

The simplest way to activate your calming nervous system: make your exhale longer than your inhale. That's it.

This works because exhaling activates your parasympathetic nervous system - the "rest and digest" mode.

## When to Use It

- Anxiety or panic
- Racing thoughts
- Can't relax
- Before sleep
- Anytime you need to calm down quickly

## Before We Start

Get comfortable. Sitting or lying down. No need to close your eyes unless you want to.

I'll count with you. Breathe in for 4, out for 6.

## Let's Begin

Start with a normal breath out, emptying your lungs.

**Now breathe IN...**
One... two... three... four.

**And OUT, slowly...**
One... two... three... four... five... six.

---

**IN...**
One... two... three... four.

**OUT, letting it all go...**
One... two... three... four... five... six.

---

**IN...**
One... two... three... four.

**OUT...**
One... two... three... four... five... six.

---

**IN...**
One... two... three... four.

**OUT...**
One... two... three... four... five... six.

---

**Last one. IN...**
One... two... three... four.

**And OUT...**
One... two... three... four... five... six.

---

## Finishing

Let your breathing return to natural. Notice if anything has shifted.

You can continue on your own - as many rounds as you need.

---

## Variations

- **4 in, 8 out:** If you want more calming effect
- **3 in, 5 out:** If 4-6 feels too long
- **Just exhale longer:** Don't count, just make the out-breath longer than the in-breath

The exact numbers don't matter. What matters is: exhale longer than inhale.

## How Claude Should Guide This

- Speak slowly and evenly
- The out-breath counts should be spoken slightly slower than the in-breath counts
- Pause between each number
- Keep your voice calm and steady
- Check in after: "How are you feeling?"
