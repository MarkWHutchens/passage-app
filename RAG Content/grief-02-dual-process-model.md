# The Dual Process Model: How Grief Actually Works

## A Better Map

The Dual Process Model (developed by Stroebe and Schut) offers a more accurate picture of how people actually grieve. It's not stages - it's oscillation.

At any given time, you're doing one of two things:

**Loss-Oriented Coping**
- Focusing on the loss itself
- Feeling the pain
- Crying, yearning, longing
- Processing memories
- Working through the relationship
- Confronting the reality of the death

**Restoration-Oriented Coping**
- Dealing with life changes
- Taking on new roles and tasks
- Developing new identity
- Distraction from grief
- Doing new things
- Building a life without the person

## The Oscillation

Here's the key insight: healthy grief involves moving back and forth between these two.

You don't "complete" loss-oriented work and then move to restoration. You oscillate. Sometimes hour by hour, sometimes day by day.

**Morning:** You wake up and the absence hits you. You cry. You look at photos. You feel the loss deeply. (Loss-oriented)

**Afternoon:** You have to deal with the estate paperwork. You meet a friend for coffee. You think about what's for dinner. (Restoration-oriented)

**Evening:** A song comes on and you're undone again. (Loss-oriented)

This isn't failing at grief. This is grief.

## Why Both Matter

**Loss-oriented work is necessary because:**
- Pain that's avoided doesn't disappear
- The relationship and the loss need to be processed
- Emotions need expression
- Reality needs to be confronted

**Restoration-oriented work is necessary because:**
- Life continues and requires attention
- Identity needs to adapt
- New skills may need to be learned
- Respite from grief prevents overwhelm
- A meaningful life needs to be rebuilt

**If you only do loss-oriented:**
- You can become stuck in grief
- Life falls apart around you
- Depression can set in
- The loss becomes your entire identity

**If you only do restoration-oriented:**
- Grief gets postponed, not avoided
- It tends to emerge later, sometimes in distorted ways
- You may feel numb or disconnected
- Relationships can suffer from emotional unavailability

## The Permission to Oscillate

Some people feel guilty when they're not actively grieving. "I laughed today - does that mean I don't care?" Others feel guilty when grief interrupts their functioning. "I should be over this by now."

The dual process model gives permission for both.

**It's okay to:**
- Laugh at something funny while grieving deeply
- Enjoy a meal while missing someone terribly
- Work productively and then fall apart at home
- Take a break from grief
- Return to grief after a break
- Not think about the person for a few hours
- Think about them constantly for days

## Natural vs. Forced

Some oscillation happens naturally. The phone rings and you have to deal with something. A wave of grief hits and you can't focus on work.

Sometimes you need to consciously choose:
- "I've been immersed in grief all day - I'm going to take a walk and think about something else for an hour"
- "I've been avoiding the grief - I'm going to sit with the photo album tonight"

Neither is wrong. You're managing your grief, not being controlled by it.

## What Gets in the Way

**Demands that don't allow oscillation:**
- A job that requires constant performance with no space for grief
- People who expect you to be "fine" or "not fine" consistently
- Circumstances that don't allow time for loss-oriented processing
- Pressure to "stay strong" all the time

**If you can't oscillate naturally**, you may need to create deliberate space for both. Grief that can't be expressed will find a way out eventually.

## When to Reference This

Use this framework when:
- Someone feels guilty for laughing or having a good day
- Someone feels guilty for crying "again"
- They're asking if it's normal to go back and forth
- They're stuck in one mode (only grieving, or avoiding all grief)
- They need permission to take breaks from grief
- They need permission to feel the pain
- They're trying to understand why grief is so unpredictable
- They're being pressured to grieve in a particular way
