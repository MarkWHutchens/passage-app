# Your Body in Recovery: The Physical Timeline

## What Happens When You Stop

Your body starts healing faster than you might think. While the first days can be rough (and for some substances require medical supervision), the benefits begin almost immediately and continue for months.

This is what you're working toward.

## The Big Picture

Your body wants to heal. Given the chance, it will.

**What helps recovery:**
- Sleep (as much as your body needs)
- Nutrition (your body needs building blocks)
- Hydration
- Movement (gentle at first)
- Time (there's no shortcut)

**Remember:**
- These timelines are approximate - everyone is different
- Some benefits happen faster, some slower
- Pre-existing conditions affect recovery
- Age, overall health, and length of use all matter
- Progress isn't always linear

**The point:** Every day without the substance, your body is healing. Even when it doesn't feel like it.

## When to Reference This

Use this framework when:
- Someone wants motivation for what they're working toward
- They're in early recovery and need hope
- They're asking when they'll feel better
- They need concrete benefits to focus on
- They're thinking about stopping and want to know what happens
- They want to understand physical (not just psychological) recovery
