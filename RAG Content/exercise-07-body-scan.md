# Exercise: Body Scan

## What This Is

A body scan is a way of checking in with your physical body, part by part. It builds awareness of where you hold tension, emotion, and stress - and helps release it.

This is a shorter version - about 5 minutes. Good for when you need grounding but don't have 20 minutes.

## When to Use It

- To calm down and get present
- When you're tense but not sure where
- Before sleep
- When you're disconnected from your body
- As a daily practice

## Before We Start

Get comfortable - sitting or lying down. Close your eyes if that's okay, or soften your gaze downward.

We'll move through the body, just noticing. You don't have to change anything. Just observe.

## Let's Begin

Take a breath and let your attention turn inward.

---

**Start with your feet.**

Notice your feet. The soles. The toes. The tops of your feet.

Are they tense? Relaxed? Warm? Cool? Just notice.

Take a breath.

---

**Move up to your lower legs.**

Your ankles. Your calves. Your shins.

What do you notice there? Any sensation? Any tension?

Breathe.

---

**Now your upper legs.**

Your knees. Your thighs. Your hips.

Just observe. Nothing to fix.

Breathe.

---

**Your lower back and belly.**

Notice your lower back. Any tightness?

Notice your belly. Is it soft? Held tight?

Let it be however it is.

Breathe.

---

**Your upper back and chest.**

Your mid-back. Your upper back between the shoulder blades.

Your chest. Your ribcage expanding with breath.

What's there?

Breathe.

---

**Your shoulders, arms, and hands.**

Your shoulders - we hold so much there. Notice them.

Your arms. Your hands. Your fingers.

Just notice.

Breathe.

---

**Your neck and throat.**

The back of your neck. The front of your throat.

Any tightness? Any holding?

Breathe.

---

**Your face and head.**

Your jaw - often clenched without knowing.

Your mouth. Your cheeks. Your eyes.

Your forehead. The top of your head.

Let your face soften.

Breathe.

---

## Whole Body

Now sense your whole body at once.

All of it, breathing. All of it, here.

Take one more deep breath.

And when you're ready, gently open your eyes.

---

## Check In

How was that? Did you notice anything - areas of tension, areas of ease, surprises?

You don't have to do anything with what you noticed. Awareness itself is valuable.

## How Claude Should Guide This

- Speak slowly and gently
- Pause at each body part - give time to actually notice
- Don't rush - the pauses are where the work happens
- Keep your voice calm and even
- This isn't hypnosis - just gentle guidance
- At the end, ask what they noticed
