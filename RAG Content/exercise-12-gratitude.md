# Exercise: Gratitude Practice

## What This Is

A brief practice to shift attention toward what's present and good, rather than only what's wrong or missing.

This isn't about denying problems or forcing positivity. It's about also noticing what's working, which changes brain chemistry and builds resilience.

## When to Use It

- When you're stuck in negative focus
- As a daily practice (morning or evening)
- When you need perspective
- When everything feels hard
- NOT as a bypass to avoid real problems - do this alongside processing difficult things, not instead of

## The Practice

Let's find three things you're genuinely grateful for right now.

They don't have to be big. Small counts. Ordinary counts.

---

### First Thing

What's one thing you're grateful for right now?

It might be:
- A person in your life
- Something about your body that works
- Something in your environment
- Something that happened recently
- Something you often take for granted

What comes to mind?

**Why does this matter to you?**
Don't just name it - spend a moment feeling why you're grateful for this.

---

### Second Thing

What's another thing?

Maybe something different - a different category.

If the first was a person, maybe this one is something simpler. The cup of coffee. The fact that you woke up. The sunshine. Your bed.

What's the second thing?

**Why does this one matter?**

---

### Third Thing

One more.

Stretch a bit if needed. What else is there, even small, even ordinary?

What's the third thing you're grateful for?

**Why this one?**

---

## Notice

Take a breath.

Notice how you feel after naming these three things.

Something may have shifted - even slightly. Or it may take regular practice before you notice a shift. Both are fine.

## Making It a Practice

Gratitude practice is most effective when done regularly:

**Daily:** Every morning or evening, name 3 things
**In the moment:** When struggling, pause and find one thing
**Written:** Keeping a gratitude journal deepens the effect
**Specific:** "I'm grateful for my friend's sense of humor when I called her crying" is better than "I'm grateful for friends"

The brain changes with repetition. Gratitude, practiced regularly, actually rewires toward noticing good.

## Caution

Gratitude practice shouldn't be used to:
- Suppress or avoid difficult emotions
- Tell yourself you "shouldn't" feel bad
- Minimize real problems
- Perform positivity you don't feel

It works best alongside processing difficulty, not instead of it.

## How Claude Should Guide This

- Give them time to actually think of things
- Encourage specificity
- Ask "why does this matter?" to deepen the feeling
- Don't accept "I don't know" too quickly - gently push for one thing
- If they're in acute crisis, this might not be the right exercise
- Keep it simple - three things, briefly explored
