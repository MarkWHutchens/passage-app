# Triggers and Coping: Building Your Response Toolkit

## What Is a Trigger?

A trigger is anything that activates the urge to use. It's a stimulus that your brain has associated with the substance or behaviour.

Triggers aren't moral failings. They're learned associations. Your brain is doing what brains do - predicting and preparing based on past experience.

## Types of Triggers

**External Triggers (environmental)**
- Places (bars, old hangouts, certain neighbourhoods)
- People (using friends, dealers, sometimes even family)
- Times (5pm, weekends, paydays)
- Objects (paraphernalia, advertisements, certain glasses or bottles)
- Events (parties, work functions, specific holidays)
- Situations (work stress, arguments, celebrations)

**Internal Triggers (emotional/physical)**
- Emotions: anxiety, anger, loneliness, boredom, even happiness
- Physical states: fatigue, hunger, pain, illness
- Thoughts: memories of using, "just one" thinking, self-pity
- Sensations: certain smells, tastes, physical tension

**Social Triggers**
- Peer pressure (direct or imagined)
- Social anxiety
- Feeling left out
- Relationship conflict
- Celebration with others

## Know Your Triggers

The first step is awareness. You can't navigate what you don't see.

**Common high-risk triggers to consider:**
- What time of day is hardest?
- What emotions precede urges?
- What places activate cravings?
- Who do you associate with using?
- What situations feel dangerous?
- What were your rituals around using?

**Pay attention to patterns.** Track your urges for a week. Note when they happen, what preceded them, how intense they were. Patterns will emerge.

## The Trigger Response: What Actually Happens

1. **Trigger occurs** (external or internal)
2. **Brain recognises pattern** (this used to mean using)
3. **Craving activates** (urge to use, physical sensations)
4. **Autopilot engages** (habitual response kicks in)
5. **Use or don't use** (depending on intervention)

The goal isn't to never experience triggers - that's impossible. The goal is to interrupt between step 3 and step 5.

## Strategies: Avoid, Escape, Cope

**Avoid (prevention)**
- Remove yourself from high-risk situations when possible
- Don't keep alcohol in the house
- Change your route home to avoid the liquor store
- Limit time with people who use
- Leave parties before the heavy drinking starts

Avoidance gets a bad reputation, but in early recovery it's essential. You're not weak for avoiding - you're strategic.

**Escape (in the moment)**
- Leave the situation if you can
- Call someone
- Physical movement (walk away, literally)
- "I need to step out for a minute"

Having an exit plan isn't paranoia - it's preparation.

**Cope (when you can't avoid or escape)**
- Ride the wave (urge surfing - urges peak and pass)
- Delay: "I'll wait 30 minutes before deciding"
- Distract: do something engaging to occupy your mind
- Dispute: challenge the thoughts driving the urge
- Breathe: regulate your nervous system
- Connect: call someone who knows your situation

## HALT: The Basic Check

Before any craving analysis, check the basics:

**H - Hungry?** Low blood sugar affects mood and decision-making
**A - Angry?** Unprocessed anger seeks outlet
**L - Lonely?** Isolation is high-risk
**T - Tired?** Fatigue destroys willpower

These four states dramatically increase vulnerability. Address them first.

## Playing the Tape Forward

When the urge says "just this once," play the full tape:

- How will you feel tomorrow morning?
- What will you tell yourself?
- How will this affect your streak/progress?
- What consequences might follow?
- How did it end the last time you gave in?

The urge only shows you the first scene. Play the whole movie.

## Building New Associations

Long-term, the goal is rewiring. The same triggers can eventually become cues for new behaviours:

- 5pm used to mean drinking → now means gym or calling a friend
- Stress used to mean using → now means walking or breathing exercises
- Loneliness used to mean isolating with substances → now means reaching out

This takes time. The old pathways don't disappear, but new ones can become stronger.

## Relapse Prevention Planning

Don't wait for a crisis. Plan ahead:

1. **List your high-risk triggers** (top 5-10)
2. **For each, identify:** avoid, escape, or cope?
3. **Who can you call?** (list 3 names with numbers)
4. **What's your immediate action plan** if urge hits?
5. **What are your warning signs** that you're slipping toward danger?

Write this down. Tell someone who can hold you accountable.

## Triggers Evolve

What triggers you in month 1 may differ from month 6 or year 2.

- Early recovery: more physical and environmental triggers
- Later recovery: more emotional and social triggers
- Long-term: complacency and forgetting the pain can be triggers

Stay aware. Recovery isn't a destination; it's ongoing navigation.

## When to Reference This

Use this framework when:
- Someone is trying to identify their triggers
- They've encountered a trigger and aren't sure what to do
- They're building a relapse prevention plan
- They're surprised by a craving and want to understand it
- They're asking about HALT
- They need practical coping strategies
- They're deciding whether to avoid a situation or try to handle it
