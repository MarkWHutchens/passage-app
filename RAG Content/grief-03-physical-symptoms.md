# Grief in the Body: Physical Symptoms of Loss

## Grief Is Not Just Emotional

When someone you love dies, it's not just your heart that hurts. Your body grieves too.

The physical symptoms of grief can be alarming if you don't know to expect them. People sometimes think they're getting sick, or that something is seriously wrong. Often, it's grief living in the body.

## Common Physical Symptoms

**Chest and Heart**
- Tightness in the chest
- Heart palpitations
- Aching in the chest ("heartache" is literal)
- Shortness of breath
- Feeling like your heart is heavy

**Stomach and Digestion**
- Nausea
- Loss of appetite or increased appetite
- Stomach pain or churning
- Changes in bowel habits
- Weight loss or gain

**Energy and Sleep**
- Profound fatigue
- Exhaustion even after sleep
- Difficulty falling asleep
- Waking in the night
- Sleeping too much
- Feeling physically weak

**Head and Cognition**
- Headaches
- Dizziness
- Brain fog ("grief brain")
- Difficulty concentrating
- Forgetting things
- Feeling disoriented

**Immune System**
- Getting sick more easily
- Slow healing
- Flare-ups of existing conditions
- General sense of being run down

**Other**
- Muscle tension and pain
- Restlessness or agitation
- Feeling cold
- Sensitivity to noise or stimulation
- Phantom sensations (feeling like you heard or saw them)

## Why This Happens

**Stress hormones.** Grief is a massive stressor. Your body floods with cortisol and adrenaline, which affects virtually every system.

**Sleep disruption.** Poor sleep impacts immune function, cognition, digestion, and energy.

**Nervous system activation.** Grief can keep you in fight-or-flight mode, which diverts resources from "maintenance" functions like digestion and immune response.

**The mind-body connection.** Emotional pain and physical pain share neural pathways. Heartbreak can register as actual pain.

**Appetite changes.** Stress affects hunger hormones. Some people can't eat; others eat for comfort.

## What Helps

**Basic care matters more than ever:**
- Eat something, even if you're not hungry (small, simple foods)
- Drink water
- Rest, even if you can't sleep
- Move your body gently (walks, stretching)
- Get outside briefly

**Don't ignore serious symptoms.** While physical symptoms are normal in grief, grief can also trigger actual health problems. Broken heart syndrome (stress cardiomyopathy) is a real condition. If you're having chest pain, severe symptoms, or anything that genuinely concerns you, see a doctor. It's okay to mention you're grieving.

**Let yourself be tired.** Grief is exhausting. You're not lazy; you're processing something enormous.

**Lower expectations.** Your capacity is reduced right now. This is temporary, but it's real.

**Breathing and grounding.** When physical symptoms spike, basic regulation can help - slow breaths, grounding exercises, cold water on wrists.

## Grief Brain

"Grief brain" deserves special mention. It's so common and so disorienting.

**What it looks like:**
- Forgetting what you were doing mid-task
- Losing track of conversations
- Trouble making decisions
- Misplacing things constantly
- Feeling "foggy" or "underwater"
- Difficulty reading or following plots
- Forgetting words

**Why it happens:** Your brain is working hard on processing the loss. There's less bandwidth for everything else. Stress hormones also impair memory and concentration.

**What helps:**
- Write things down
- Simplify decisions
- Don't make big decisions if you can avoid it
- Be patient with yourself
- Know it improves over time

## Timeline

Physical symptoms are usually most intense in acute grief (first weeks to months). They typically ease as the grief integrates, though they may resurge around anniversaries or triggers.

If physical symptoms persist severely, especially beyond the first several months, check in with a healthcare provider. Sometimes grief unmasks or triggers conditions that need attention.

## When to Reference This

Use this framework when:
- Someone is alarmed by physical symptoms during grief
- They're wondering if something is physically wrong with them
- They feel guilty for being so tired or non-functional
- They're experiencing grief brain and think they're losing their mind
- They need reassurance that physical symptoms are normal
- They need practical advice for managing bodily grief
- They're not taking basic care of themselves
