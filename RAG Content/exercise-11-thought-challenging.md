# Exercise: Challenging a Difficult Thought

## What This Is

A way to examine a thought that's causing you distress. Not to replace it with forced positivity, but to check if it's accurate - and find a more realistic perspective.

Based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) principles.

## When to Use It

- When you're stuck on a painful thought
- When you're catastrophizing
- When you notice thinking distortions
- When your thoughts are making things worse than they need to be

## The Exercise

Think of a thought that's been bothering you. Something you keep thinking that causes distress.

Write it down or say it clearly. We'll examine it together.

---

### Step 1: What's the Thought?

State the thought as specifically as possible.

Not "I feel bad" but the actual thought:
- "I'm going to fail."
- "Nobody cares about me."
- "I'll never recover."
- "I'm a burden to everyone."
- "This will definitely go wrong."

What's your thought?

### Step 2: How Does It Make You Feel?

When you have this thought, what emotions come up? And how strong are they (0-10)?

For example:
- Anxious (8)
- Sad (6)
- Hopeless (7)

What feelings does this thought create?

### Step 3: What's the Evidence?

Now let's examine the thought like a scientist.

**What evidence SUPPORTS this thought?**
What facts (not feelings, not interpretations - actual facts) support this being true?

**What evidence is AGAINST this thought?**
What facts contradict it? What have you overlooked? What would you point out to a friend who had this thought?

Take your time with this. Often we accept thoughts without ever checking the evidence.

### Step 4: Is There a Thinking Trap?

Common distortions - does your thought fit any of these?

- **Catastrophizing:** Jumping to the worst case
- **Mind-reading:** Assuming you know what others think
- **All-or-nothing:** Black/white thinking with no middle
- **Overgeneralizing:** One instance becomes "always" or "never"
- **Emotional reasoning:** "I feel it, so it must be true"
- **Fortune-telling:** Predicting negative outcomes
- **Discounting positives:** Good things "don't count"

Does a trap apply here?

### Step 5: What Would You Tell a Friend?

If a good friend came to you with this exact thought, what would you say to them?

Would you agree with the thought? Or would you offer a different perspective?

What would that perspective be?

---

### Step 6: A More Realistic Thought

Based on the evidence and what you'd tell a friend, what's a more balanced, realistic thought?

This isn't toxic positivity. It's not "everything is fine" if it isn't.

It might be:
- "I might fail, but I've succeeded before too."
- "Some people care about me, even if not everyone."
- "I don't know how this will turn out - I'm predicting based on fear."
- "This is hard, AND I've handled hard things before."

What's a more realistic version of your original thought?

---

### Step 7: Check In

How do you feel now? Rate those same emotions again.

Often, even slightly shifting the thought shifts the feeling. Not to zero - but maybe from 8 to 5.

## Practice

This gets easier with practice. You can do it:
- In your head when you notice a distressing thought
- Written down for more impact
- With someone else (therapist, friend, this app)

The goal is building a habit of examining thoughts rather than automatically believing them.

## How Claude Should Guide This

- Go through steps one at a time
- Help them be specific about the thought
- On evidence, gently challenge if they only see one side
- Point out thinking traps if you notice them
- The balanced thought should come from them, not be imposed
- This is collaborative, not lecture
