# Medical Trauma: When Treatment Is Traumatic

## Not Just the Illness

Sometimes it's not just the illness that's hard. It's what you went through to treat it.

Surgeries. Procedures. ICU stays. Chemotherapy. Hospitalisations. Diagnostic tests. Complications. Near-death experiences.

These can be traumatic - genuinely traumatic, not just difficult. And that trauma needs attention.

## What Makes Medical Experience Traumatic

Trauma occurs when an event overwhelms your capacity to cope. Medical trauma specifically involves:

**Life threat.** Facing death - your own or feeling you might die.

**Loss of control.** Being at the mercy of medical teams, procedures, your body's failures.

**Bodily invasion.** Surgeries, procedures, examinations - your body boundary is repeatedly crossed.

**Pain.** Unmanaged or poorly managed pain is traumatic.

**Helplessness.** Unable to stop what's happening. Unable to escape.

**Dehumanisation.** Being treated as a body rather than a person. Being talked about rather than talked to.

**Isolation.** Alone in hospital. Separated from support. Pandemic-era restrictions.

**Witnessing others' suffering.** In ICU, cancer wards, anywhere you see others in crisis.

## Signs of Medical Trauma

Medical trauma can show up as:

### Re-experiencing
- Intrusive memories of medical events
- Nightmares about hospitals or procedures
- Flashbacks triggered by medical settings
- Distress when reminded of treatment

### Avoidance
- Avoiding doctors, hospitals, medical settings
- Postponing necessary care
- Not talking about what happened
- Avoiding reminders (shows about illness, certain smells)

### Hyperarousal
- Anxiety about medical appointments
- Panic attacks in medical settings
- Difficulty sleeping
- Exaggerated startle response
- Constant vigilance about health

### Negative changes
- Shame about what happened to your body
- Feeling permanently damaged
- Difficulty trusting medical professionals
- Negative beliefs about yourself or the world
- Emotional numbness

## Why It's Often Unrecognised

Medical trauma is frequently missed or minimised:

**"But it saved your life."** Yes, and it was also traumatic. Both are true.

**"You should be grateful."** Gratitude and trauma aren't opposites. You can be grateful AND traumatised.

**Medical professionals may not see it.** They're focused on treating disease, not the psychological impact of treatment.

**You might not recognise it yourself.** "It was just treatment. Why am I so affected?"

**It can be delayed.** During treatment, you're in survival mode. The trauma response may emerge afterward, once you're "safe."

## Common Sources

- ICU stays (particularly with ventilation, sedation, delirium)
- Cancer treatment (chemo, radiation, surgeries)
- Emergency surgeries
- Difficult childbirth
- Procedures done without adequate pain management
- Medical errors or complications
- Being given devastating news poorly
- Feeling unheard or dismissed by medical teams
- Prolonged hospitalisations
- Invasive diagnostic procedures

## Healing from Medical Trauma

### Name it

Acknowledge that what happened was traumatic. Not dramatic - traumatic. Give yourself permission to treat it as such.

### Get support

Trauma-informed therapy can help:
- EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing)
- Trauma-focused CBT
- Somatic therapies
- General therapy with someone who understands medical trauma

### Tell the story (when ready)

Trauma needs to be processed, not suppressed. With a safe person or therapist, telling the story of what happened can be healing.

### Body-based healing

Trauma lives in the body. Approaches that address this:
- Gentle yoga
- Somatic experiencing
- Breathing practices
- Gradual reintroduction of body awareness

### Graded exposure

If you're avoiding necessary medical care, gradual exposure can help:
- Start small (phone call to make appointment)
- Build up (going to waiting room, then leaving)
- Have support present when needed
- Communicate with providers about your history

### Communicate with medical teams

If possible, tell providers about your trauma history:
- "I have significant medical trauma and may need extra support"
- "I need to know what's happening before you do anything"
- "Please explain everything step by step"
- "I may need breaks during procedures"

Good providers will adapt their approach.

## For Future Medical Care

Medical trauma can make necessary care feel impossible. But avoiding care has its own risks.

**Strategies:**
- Bring a support person
- Request sedation or additional pain management when appropriate
- Choose providers who take your concerns seriously
- Communicate your needs and limits clearly
- Have a plan for if you're overwhelmed
- Acknowledge that choosing care despite trauma is brave, not easy

## When to Reference This

Use this framework when:
- Someone has been through difficult medical treatment
- They're showing signs of trauma related to medical care
- They're avoiding necessary healthcare due to past experiences
- They feel guilty for being traumatised by treatment that "helped"
- They need validation that medical trauma is real
- They need strategies for healing or managing future care
