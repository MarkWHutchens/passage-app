# The Spectrum: From Use to Addiction

## Not All Harmful Use Is Addiction

There's a spectrum. Understanding where someone sits on it matters for how they think about their situation and what they do next.

**Recreational/Social Use**
- Take it or leave it
- No negative consequences
- Doesn't affect other areas of life
- Can stop without difficulty

**Problematic/Harmful Use**
- Starting to cause problems (health, relationships, work, finances)
- Using more than intended
- Some regret after use
- Could stop if motivated, but haven't
- Not yet physically dependent

**Dependence**
- Tolerance has built (need more to feel the same effect)
- Withdrawal symptoms when stopping
- Using to feel "normal" rather than to feel good
- Significant impact on life
- Stopping is difficult but possible with support

**Addiction**
- Loss of control despite consequences
- Compulsive use
- Life increasingly organised around the substance/behaviour
- Continued use despite serious harm
- Brain changes that make stopping extremely difficult
- Often requires significant intervention and support

## The Progression: "Man Takes a Drink, Drink Takes a Drink, Drink Takes a Man"

This old saying captures something important: addiction is progressive.

**Stage 1: You use it**
You're in control. You choose when, how much, whether to partake. It's a tool you pick up and put down. It enhances experiences or takes edges off.

**Stage 2: It starts using you**
Something shifts. You need it to feel okay. You think about it when it's not there. You use more than you planned. You organise your life to accommodate it. You might not notice this happening.

**Stage 3: It has you**
The relationship has inverted. What once served you now controls you. You can't imagine life without it. You've tried to stop or cut back and couldn't. You're making choices you never thought you would.

## Tolerance: The Quiet Slide

Tolerance is the body adapting. What once gave you a buzz now just makes you feel normal. To get the original effect, you need more.

This is biological, not moral weakness. Your brain literally changes to accommodate the substance. Receptors downregulate. Pathways adapt.

The danger: tolerance means you're consuming more. More damage to body, brain, relationships, finances. And as tolerance builds, dependence often follows.

Signs tolerance is developing:
- "I can drink more than my friends without feeling it"
- "I need a couple just to take the edge off"
- "That amount used to affect me more"
- "I've gradually been using more over time"

## Why This Spectrum Matters

**It's not binary.** You don't have to identify as an "addict" or "alcoholic" to recognise that your relationship with a substance or behaviour has become problematic.

**Early recognition helps.** Catching problematic use before it becomes dependence or addiction makes change easier. Not easy - but easier.

**It removes shame from the equation.** Understanding this as a spectrum, with biological and psychological components, helps people see their situation more clearly without the weight of moral judgement.

**It guides next steps.** Someone in early problematic use might benefit from harm reduction and self-examination. Someone in full addiction likely needs more intensive support, possibly medical help, and shouldn't try to white-knuckle it alone.

## Questions to Sit With

- Has your tolerance changed over time?
- Do you use to feel normal rather than to feel good?
- Have you tried to cut back and found it harder than expected?
- Is your use causing problems in areas of your life?
- Do you think about it when you're not using?
- Would people who care about you be concerned if they knew the full picture?

These aren't diagnostic questions. They're invitations to honest self-reflection.

## When to Reference This

Use this framework when:
- Someone is unsure if they "really have a problem"
- They're comparing themselves to "real addicts" to minimise their situation
- They've noticed their tolerance increasing
- They're in the early stages of recognising problematic patterns
- They're trying to understand how they got here
- They use phrases like "I can stop whenever I want, I just don't want to"
