# Exercise: Physiological Sigh

## What This Is

The fastest way to calm down - backed by neuroscience research from Stanford (Andrew Huberman). It's what your body naturally does when you sigh, sob, or come up for air.

Two quick inhales through the nose, one long exhale through the mouth. Takes about 10 seconds.

## When to Use It

- Acute stress or anxiety
- Need to calm down NOW
- In the middle of a stressful situation
- Can't do a longer breathing exercise
- Before you say something you'll regret
- Any moment you need quick regulation

## How It Works

The double inhale reinflates tiny air sacs in your lungs that have collapsed. This actually changes your blood chemistry in a way that signals your brain to calm down. The long exhale activates your parasympathetic nervous system.

It's not just relaxation - it's physiology.

## Let's Do It

This is quick. Ready?

**Two quick breaths IN through your nose** - the first fills your lungs, the second tops them off.

*sniff sniff* (like that, through your nose)

**Then one long breath OUT through your mouth.**

Let it all go.

---

That's it. One cycle.

Let's do it again.

**Two inhales through the nose...** sniff, sniff

**Long exhale through the mouth...** let it all out.

---

One more.

**Double inhale...** sniff, sniff

**Long exhale...** ahhhhh

## How Do You Feel?

Even just 1-3 of these can shift your state. You might notice:
- Shoulders dropping
- Heart rate slowing
- A small sense of relief
- Feeling slightly more settled

## Using It in Real Life

The beauty of this one: you can do it anywhere, anytime, without anyone noticing.

- In a meeting that's stressing you out
- Before walking into a difficult conversation
- When you feel panic rising
- When you catch yourself holding your breath
- Anytime

You don't need to close your eyes, sit down, or take five minutes. Just: sniff-sniff, exhale.

## How Claude Should Guide This

- This is quick - don't over-explain
- Demonstrate the pattern simply
- Do 2-3 cycles with them
- The "sniff sniff" framing helps people understand the double inhale
- Check if they feel any different after
