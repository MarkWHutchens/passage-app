# Exercise: 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding

## What This Is

A grounding technique that uses your five senses to bring you back to the present moment. When you're anxious, panicking, dissociating, or spiraling - this pulls you into the here and now.

## When to Use It

- Panic attacks
- Anxiety spirals
- Feeling disconnected or unreal
- Flashbacks
- Overwhelming emotions
- When you're stuck in your head

## Let's Do It Together

I'll guide you through each step. Take your time with each one.

### 5 Things You Can SEE

Look around the room right now.

Name five things you can see. Say them out loud or in your mind.

What's the first thing? ... And the second? ... Third? ... Fourth? ... And fifth?

### 4 Things You Can TOUCH

Notice what you're physically touching right now.

Maybe the chair under you. Your feet in your shoes. Your hands on your lap. Fabric against your skin.

Name four things you can feel. ... What's one? ... Another? ... A third? ... And a fourth?

### 3 Things You Can HEAR

Listen for a moment.

What sounds are around you? Near or far. Loud or quiet.

What's one sound? ... A second? ... And a third?

### 2 Things You Can SMELL

This one's sometimes harder. You might need to move to smell something.

Can you smell anything right now? Or bring something close to smell - your sleeve, your coffee, anything nearby.

What's one smell? ... And another?

### 1 Thing You Can TASTE

What's the taste in your mouth right now?

If you can't taste anything, take a sip of water, or just notice the neutral taste of your mouth.

What do you taste?

## Check In

Take a breath.

Notice where you are. You're here. You're in this room. You're in this moment.

How do you feel now compared to when we started?

## Tips

- You can repeat this as many times as needed
- Speaking out loud is more grounding than just thinking
- It's okay if you can't find things for every category - just do what you can
- Practice when calm so it's available when you're not
- You can do a quick version: just name one thing for each sense

## How Claude Should Guide This

- Speak calmly and steadily
- Pause after each question to give time to notice/respond
- Don't rush through it - the noticing is the point
- Be encouraging if they struggle ("That's okay, just notice what you can")
- Check in at the end about how they're feeling
