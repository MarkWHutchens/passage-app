# Thinking Traps: Common Distortions That Cause Suffering

## How Thoughts Create Suffering

It's not just what happens to you that causes suffering. It's how you think about what happens.

The same event can be interpreted many ways. Some interpretations cause more pain than necessary. These are cognitive distortions - habitual thinking patterns that distort reality in painful directions.

Recognizing these patterns doesn't make them go away instantly. But it loosens their grip.

## Common Distortions

### All-or-Nothing Thinking

Seeing things in black and white, with no middle ground.

**Examples:**
- "If I'm not perfect, I'm a complete failure."
- "Either they love me or they hate me."
- "I relapsed, so my whole recovery is ruined."

**Reality:** Most things exist on a spectrum. Partial success is still success. Nuance is real.

### Catastrophising

Jumping to the worst possible outcome.

**Examples:**
- "This headache is probably brain cancer."
- "They didn't text back - they must be ending the relationship."
- "I made a mistake at work, I'll definitely be fired."

**Reality:** The worst case rarely happens. And even when bad things happen, they're usually survivable.

### Mind Reading

Assuming you know what others are thinking (usually negative).

**Examples:**
- "They think I'm boring."
- "Everyone can tell I don't belong here."
- "She's judging me for how I look."

**Reality:** You don't know what others are thinking. And you're usually wrong when you guess.

### Fortune Telling

Predicting the future (usually negatively).

**Examples:**
- "This will never work out."
- "I'll always feel this way."
- "There's no point trying - I'll just fail."

**Reality:** You can't predict the future. Things change. Predictions are often wrong.

### Filtering

Focusing only on the negative, filtering out the positive.

**Examples:**
- Getting 10 compliments and 1 criticism, then only thinking about the criticism.
- Ignoring everything that went well in a situation.
- Seeing only what's wrong in your life.

**Reality:** Negative things exist, but so do positive things. Selective attention distorts the picture.

### Discounting the Positive

Dismissing good things as not counting.

**Examples:**
- "They only said that to be nice."
- "That success was just luck."
- "Anyone could have done that."

**Reality:** Positive things are real. They count. They're not exceptions to be dismissed.

### Should Statements

Rigid rules about how things "should" be.

**Examples:**
- "I should be over this by now."
- "They should have known better."
- "I shouldn't feel this way."

**Reality:** "Should" often creates suffering without changing reality. Things are as they are.

### Emotional Reasoning

Believing that because you feel something, it must be true.

**Examples:**
- "I feel like a failure, so I must be one."
- "I feel unsafe, so I must be in danger."
- "I feel unlovable, so I must be."

**Reality:** Feelings are real but not always accurate. Feeling something doesn't make it true.

### Labeling

Reducing yourself or others to a single negative label.

**Examples:**
- "I'm a loser."
- "She's a terrible person."
- "I'm broken."

**Reality:** Humans are complex. A single word can't capture someone's totality.

### Personalisation

Blaming yourself for things outside your control.

**Examples:**
- "They're upset - it must be my fault."
- "My child is struggling - I must have failed as a parent."
- "The project failed because of me."

**Reality:** Many factors cause outcomes. You're usually not as central as you think.

### Overgeneralisation

Taking one instance and applying it to everything.

**Examples:**
- "This didn't work, so nothing will."
- "I failed once, so I always fail."
- "One person rejected me, so everyone will."

**Reality:** One instance is one instance. It's not a universal law.

## What to Do With Distortions

### 1. Notice them
Awareness is the first step. "Oh, I'm catastrophising." Just naming it creates distance.

### 2. Question them
- Is this thought true?
- What evidence supports it? What evidence contradicts it?
- What would I tell a friend thinking this?
- Is there another way to see this?

### 3. Reframe
Not forced positivity - realistic reframing.
- "This is definitely a disaster" → "This is hard, and I don't know how it will turn out"
- "I'm a failure" → "I'm struggling with this particular thing"
- "They must hate me" → "I don't actually know what they think"

### 4. Practice
Cognitive patterns are habits. Changing them takes repetition. It gets easier.

## Thoughts Are Not Facts

You have thousands of thoughts a day. Many are distorted, habitual, automatic.

**You don't have to believe every thought you have.**

You can notice thoughts, question them, let them pass. They're mental events, not truths.

## When to Reference This

Use this framework when:
- Someone is stuck in negative thinking patterns
- Their thoughts are causing more suffering than the situation warrants
- They need help identifying their thinking traps
- They need tools for questioning distorted thoughts
- They're treating their thoughts as absolute truth
- They're ready to examine their cognitive patterns
