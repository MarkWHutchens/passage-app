# Exercise: Box Breathing

## What This Is

Box breathing is a simple technique to calm your nervous system. It's called "box" because all four parts are equal length - like the sides of a box.

## When to Use It

- When you're feeling anxious or stressed
- Before a difficult conversation
- When you can't sleep
- Anytime you need to calm down

## Before We Start

Find a comfortable position. You can sit or lie down. Close your eyes if that feels okay, or soften your gaze.

We'll do this together. I'll count out loud with you. Each count is about one second.

## Let's Begin

Take a normal breath to start, then we'll begin the pattern.

**Breathe IN through your nose...**
One... two... three... four.

**Hold your breath gently...**
One... two... three... four.

**Breathe OUT slowly through your mouth...**
One... two... three... four.

**Hold empty...**
One... two... three... four.

---

**Again. Breathe IN...**
One... two... three... four.

**Hold...**
One... two... three... four.

**Breathe OUT...**
One... two... three... four.

**Hold empty...**
One... two... three... four.

---

**Once more. IN...**
One... two... three... four.

**Hold...**
One... two... three... four.

**OUT...**
One... two... three... four.

**Hold...**
One... two... three... four.

## Finishing

Let your breath return to normal. Notice how you feel.

You can do more rounds on your own if you'd like. The more you practice, the more effective it becomes.

## Tips

- If 4 counts feels too long, try 3
- Don't force or strain - this should feel calming, not stressful
- Practice when you're calm so it's easier when you're activated
- You can do this anywhere - no one needs to know

## How Claude Should Guide This

When guiding this exercise:
- Speak slowly and calmly
- Pause between each count (the ellipses indicate pauses)
- Don't rush - the pacing matters more than getting through it
- Check in afterward: "How do you feel now?"
